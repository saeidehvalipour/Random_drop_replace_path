1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and proliferation. The effectiveness of temozolomide is influenced by the activity of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme, which can repair the DNA damage caused by temozolomide.

2. **MGMT and IRF1 connection**: The abstract ""Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy"" mentions that methionine stress can inhibit the growth of brain tumor xenografts and enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide. This is associated with the downregulation of MGMT expression. Additionally, methionine stress upregulates IRF-1, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune responses.

3. **IRF1's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis**: IRF1 is known to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Its upregulation can lead to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.

4. **Temozolomide's effect on IRF1**: Although there is no direct mention of temozolomide's effect on IRF1 in the provided abstracts, it can be inferred that temozolomide's ability to induce DNA damage and activate cell cycle checkpoints may lead to the upregulation of IRF1. This is because IRF1 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

5. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Based on the above points, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 can be proposed. Temozolomide's DNA damaging effects can lead to the upregulation of IRF1, either directly or through the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair mechanisms. The upregulation of IRF1 can, in turn, contribute to the inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation, enhancing the efficacy of temozolomide.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, involves the following steps:

Temozolomide → DNA damage → Cell cycle checkpoint activation → IRF1 upregulation → Inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation

This proposed relationship highlights the potential for IRF1 to play a role in the mechanism of action of temozolomide, and further research is needed to fully elucidate this connection.",33.195026874542236,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0069197', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '17102778', 'added': '2418942'}",1,"('C0069197', 'C1530270')",17102778,2418942

3. **Indirect relationship**: While there is no direct mention of temozolomide inducing IRF1 expression, the connection between temozolomide's mechanism of action and IRF1 can be inferred through the MGMT enzyme. Temozolomide's effectiveness is reduced by MGMT activity. Methionine stress, which can be induced by dietary restriction and administration of methioninase, inhibits MGMT expression and enhances temozolomide's efficacy. This methionine stress also upregulates IRF-1, suggesting that the conditions under which temozolomide is more effective (i.e., low MGMT activity) are also conditions under which IRF-1 is upregulated.

4. **Potential intermediate processes**: The upregulation of IRF-1 in response to methionine stress and its association with enhanced efficacy of temozolomide suggests that IRF-1 could play a role in sensitizing cancer cells to temozolomide. This could occur through various intermediate processes, such as modulation of cell cycle checkpoints, induction of apoptosis, or alteration of DNA repair mechanisms, which are all influenced by IRF-1.

A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '20706757', 'added': '17097370'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",20706757,17097370

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that induces cytotoxicity in cancer cells by forming O6-methylguanine adducts in DNA. The repair of these adducts is mediated by the enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).
2. **MGMT promoter methylation status**: The abstract ""Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status"" suggests that the MGMT promoter methylation status is a predictive biomarker for the response to temozolomide treatment. Patients with methylated MGMT promoters tend to have better outcomes with temozolomide treatment.
3. **Methionine stress and IRF1 upregulation**: The abstract ""Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy"" describes a treatment strategy that involves reducing methionine levels to induce stress in cancer cells. This stress leads to the upregulation of various genes, including IRF1, which is involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune responses.
4. **IRF1's role in cancer cell response to temozolomide**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, IRF1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. It is possible that IRF1 upregulation in response to methionine stress could enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to temozolomide-induced DNA damage.
5. **PARP-1 inhibition and temozolomide synergy**: The abstract ""PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency"" suggests that PARP-1 inhibition can enhance the efficacy of temozolomide treatment by inducing synthetic lethality in cancer cells. This synergy could be related to the upregulation of IRF1, as PARP-1 inhibition has been shown to regulate IRF1 expression in other contexts.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed as follows:

Temozolomide treatment → MGMT promoter methylation status → Methionine stress → IRF1 upregulation → Enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide-induced DNA damage → Synergy with PARP-1 inhibition → Increased efficacy of temozolomide treatment

This proposed mechanism highlights the potential for IRF1 to play a role in the response of cancer cells to temozolomide treatment, particularly in the context of methionine stress and PARP-1 inhibition. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the relationships between these entities and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting IRF1 in combination with temozolomide treatment.",35.40808725357056,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '32901889', 'added': '16222105'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",32901889,16222105

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and proliferation. As mentioned in the first abstract, temozolomide is used in combination with radiotherapy to treat glioblastoma.

2. **MGMT promoter methylation status**: The effectiveness of temozolomide is influenced by the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Patients with methylated MGMT promoters tend to respond better to temozolomide treatment, as seen in the first abstract.

3. **Methionine stress and IRF1 upregulation**: The fifth abstract discusses the concept of methionine stress, which involves reducing plasma methionine levels to inhibit the growth of malignant cells. This treatment approach leads to the upregulation of IRF1, among other genes, and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents like temozolomide.

4. **IRF1's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis**: IRF1 is a transcription factor involved in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Its upregulation in response to methionine stress can contribute to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.

By connecting these elements, it can be proposed that temozolomide treatment may indirectly influence IRF1 protein expression through the following pathway:

- Temozolomide treatment leads to DNA damage and the activation of cellular stress responses.
- The stress response may involve the downregulation of methionine metabolism, leading to a state of methionine stress.
- Methionine stress, in turn, upregulates IRF1 expression, which contributes to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.
- The upregulation of IRF1 may also enhance the efficacy of temozolomide treatment by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damage.

This proposed indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein highlights the complex interplay between cellular stress responses, methionine metabolism, and the regulation of transcription factors involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship and its potential implications for cancer therapy.",28.589507579803467,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

MR visualization of the insula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made possible non-invasive research on the living human brain. However, three-dimensional display of areas obscured by the operculum deep within the cortex has been difficult. This study used MRI in an attempt to establish a three-dimensional method of displaying an obscured brain structure (the insula). A three-dimensional image of the insular cortex was constructed from horizontal MR images. As a result, the major anatomical landmarks of the insula were clearly displayed. This method makes possible non-invasive display and analysis of obscured structures deep in the brain, overcoming the disadvantage presented by the use of sectional images.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370', '16222105'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and MGMT Methylation**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat glioblastoma, and its effectiveness is influenced by the methylation status of the O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) gene. MGMT methylation leads to reduced expression of the MGMT protein, which is responsible for repairing the DNA damage caused by TMZ, thereby making the tumor more susceptible to the drug.

2. **XAF1 and Resistance to Temozolomide**: XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, is found to promote resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of XAF1 is negatively correlated with its promoter methylation status and GBM patient survival, suggesting that higher XAF1 expression (possibly due to lower promoter methylation) is associated with poorer patient outcomes.

3. **IRF1 and Methionine Stress**: The abstract on ""Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy"" mentions that methionine stress (induced by reducing plasma methionine levels) can enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, such as TMZ. This approach involves the upregulation of several genes, including IRF-1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1), which plays a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

4. **Connecting Temozolomide, XAF1, and IRF1**: While there is no direct mention of IRF1 in the context of XAF1 or temozolomide resistance in the provided abstracts, we can hypothesize an indirect relationship. Methionine stress, which upregulates IRF-1, can potentially influence the expression or activity of XAF1, given that both are involved in pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis. If IRF-1 upregulation leads to decreased XAF1 expression or activity, this could enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide, as reduced XAF1 levels would likely decrease the adaptive resistance to TMZ.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be mediated through the effects of methionine stress on IRF-1 upregulation, which in turn could influence XAF1 expression or function, ultimately affecting the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide. This proposed relationship highlights the complex interplay between different molecular pathways in determining the response to chemotherapy agents like temozolomide.",33.195026874542236,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0069197', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '17102778', 'added': '2418942'}",1,"('C0069197', 'C1530270')",17102778,2418942

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and MGMT Methylation**: The first abstract discusses how epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is a surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). MGMT methylation status affects the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ. High MGMT methylation enhances genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ.

2. **XAF1 and Resistance to Temozolomide**: The same abstract introduces XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promotes resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo, suggesting its role in the development of resistance to TMZ.

3. **IRF1 Upregulation in Methionine Stress**: The abstract on ""Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy"" mentions that methionine stress (induced by reducing plasma methionine levels) can upregulate IRF-1 among other factors, leading to inhibition of cell cycle and enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy, including potentially affecting the efficacy of alkylating agents like temozolomide.

4. **Connecting the Dots**: While there's no direct mention of IRF1 in the context of temozolomide resistance or XAF1 in the provided abstracts, we can hypothesize an indirect relationship. If methionine stress can upregulate IRF-1 and enhance chemotherapy efficacy, and considering that XAF1 is involved in resistance mechanisms to temozolomide, it's plausible that IRF-1 could influence XAF1 expression or function. This influence could either be direct, through transcriptional regulation, or indirect, by affecting cellular pathways that intersect with XAF1's role in resistance.

5. **Potential Mechanism**: A potential indirect relationship could be that IRF-1, upregulated under conditions of methionine stress, could modulate the expression or activity of XAF1. If IRF-1 downregulates XAF1 or inhibits its function, this could enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to temozolomide by reducing the adaptive resistance mechanisms mediated by XAF1. Conversely, if IRF-1 upregulates XAF1, it might contribute to resistance, although this would contradict the premise that IRF-1 enhances chemotherapy efficacy.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be mediated through the modulation of XAF1 by IRF-1 under conditions of methionine stress, affecting the adaptive resistance of cancer cells to temozolomide. This relationship is speculative and based on connecting elements from different abstracts, highlighting the need for direct research into the interactions between IRF-1, XAF1, and temozolomide resistance mechanisms.",31.69631314277649,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '20706757', 'added': '17097370'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",20706757,17097370

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated.

Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug used to treat certain types of cancer, including glioblastoma. IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell growth.

The indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein can be inferred from the following connections:

1. **Temozolomide and MGMT**: Temozolomide works by alkylating DNA, which leads to cell death. However, the enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) can repair this damage, making cells resistant to temozolomide. The abstract ""Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma"" suggests that MGMT methylation status affects the response to temozolomide.

2. **MGMT and Methionine Stress**: The abstract ""Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy"" describes how methionine stress (induced by reducing plasma methionine levels) can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, including temozolomide. Methionine stress inhibits the growth of tumor cells and increases the expression of IRF1, among other genes.

3. **IRF1 and Tumor Response**: IRF1 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The upregulation of IRF1 in response to methionine stress suggests that IRF1 may play a role in the enhanced efficacy of temozolomide under these conditions.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein can be described as follows: temozolomide's efficacy is affected by MGMT methylation status, which can be influenced by methionine stress. Methionine stress, in turn, upregulates IRF1, which may contribute to the enhanced efficacy of temozolomide. This relationship is indirect because temozolomide does not directly interact with IRF1, but rather, its efficacy is influenced by a series of intermediate mechanisms involving MGMT and methionine stress.

The key intermediate entities or processes in this relationship are:

* MGMT methylation status
* Methionine stress
* IRF1 upregulation

These entities and processes connect temozolomide to IRF1, illustrating a possible indirect linkage between the two.",35.40808725357056,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '32901889', 'added': '16222105'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",32901889,16222105

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and MGMT Methylation**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat glioblastoma, and its efficacy is influenced by the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. MGMT methylation leads to decreased MGMT expression, which in turn increases the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ. However, the adaptive resistance mechanisms that glioblastoma cells develop over time can reduce the effectiveness of TMZ.

2. **IRF1 and Methionine Stress**: The abstract on ""Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy"" mentions that methionine stress can enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, such as TMZ, by inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. This process involves the upregulation of IRF-1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1), among other factors. IRF-1 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The upregulation of IRF-1 in response to methionine stress suggests a potential link between IRF-1 and the enhanced efficacy of TMZ.

3. **Connecting Temozolomide and IRF1**: While there is no direct mention of a relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred through the context of methionine stress and its effects on tumor cells. Methionine stress can make tumor cells more susceptible to the effects of TMZ by modulating various cellular pathways, including those involving IRF-1. Therefore, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be mediated by the effects of methionine stress on tumor cells, which enhances the efficacy of TMZ through the upregulation of IRF-1 and other factors.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is based on the concept that methionine stress can enhance the efficacy of TMZ by upregulating IRF-1 and modulating other cellular pathways involved in tumor cell growth and survival. This relationship highlights the potential for targeting methionine metabolism as a strategy to improve the effectiveness of TMZ in cancer therapy.",28.589507579803467,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

MR visualization of the insula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made possible non-invasive research on the living human brain. However, three-dimensional display of areas obscured by the operculum deep within the cortex has been difficult. This study used MRI in an attempt to establish a three-dimensional method of displaying an obscured brain structure (the insula). A three-dimensional image of the insular cortex was constructed from horizontal MR images. As a result, the major anatomical landmarks of the insula were clearly displayed. This method makes possible non-invasive display and analysis of obscured structures deep in the brain, overcoming the disadvantage presented by the use of sectional images.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370', '16222105'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma. It is found that XAF1 promotes resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo.

2. **XAF1 and IRF1 interaction**: The fifth abstract reveals that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF1. This interaction enhances stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells.

3. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Considering the findings from the first and fifth abstracts, it can be inferred that temozolomide treatment may influence the expression or activity of XAF1, which in turn affects the IRF1 protein. If XAF1 is upregulated or activated in response to temozolomide, it could lead to the stabilization and activation of IRF1, potentially enhancing the apoptotic stress response and suppressing tumorigenesis.

4. **Intermediate entities or processes**: The second abstract mentions that XAF1 promoter methylation is associated with IDH1 mutations in high-grade gliomas. This suggests that epigenetic modifications, such as promoter methylation, may play a role in regulating XAF1 expression and, subsequently, IRF1 activity.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, may involve the following sequence of events:

Temozolomide treatment → XAF1 upregulation/activation → IRF1 stabilization/activation → Enhanced apoptotic stress response and tumorigenesis suppression

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0069197', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '17102778', 'added': '2418942'}",1,"('C0069197', 'C1530270')",17102778,2418942

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma. It is found that XAF1 promotes resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo.

2. **XAF1 and IRF1 interaction**: The fifth abstract reveals that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF1. This interaction enhances stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells.

3. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Considering the findings from the first and fifth abstracts, it can be inferred that temozolomide treatment may influence the expression or activity of XAF1, which in turn affects the IRF1 protein. If XAF1 is downregulated or epigenetically silenced in response to temozolomide, this could disrupt the positive feedback loop between XAF1 and IRF1, potentially leading to reduced IRF1 activity. Conversely, if XAF1 is upregulated, it may enhance IRF1 activity, contributing to increased apoptotic stress response and suppression of tumorigenesis.

4. **Intermediate entities or processes**: The second abstract mentions that XAF1 promoter methylation is associated with IDH1 mutations in high-grade gliomas. This suggests that IDH1 mutations may be an intermediate factor influencing the relationship between temozolomide and IRF1, potentially through effects on XAF1 expression or epigenetic regulation.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, may involve the following sequence of events:

Temozolomide treatment → affects XAF1 expression or epigenetic regulation → influences the XAF1-IRF1 positive feedback loop → impacts IRF1 activity and apoptotic stress response → contributes to tumorigenesis or tumor suppression.

This proposed relationship highlights the complexity of the underlying mechanisms and the potential involvement of intermediate entities, such as IDH1 mutations, in modulating the effects of temozolomide on IRF1 protein activity.",31.69631314277649,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '20706757', 'added': '17097370'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",20706757,17097370

1. **Temozolomide resistance and XAF1**: The first abstract mentions that XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically mediates differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma cells. XAF1 promotes resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo.
2. **XAF1 and IRF1 interaction**: The fifth abstract reveals that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF1, where XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF1. This interaction enhances stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells.
3. **IRF1 and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)**: The fourth abstract shows that hyper-activated IRF1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced ISG expression, including XAF1, in response to interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells.
4. **Temozolomide and epigenetic regulation**: The first abstract mentions that epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is a surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide. MGMT methylation status affects the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ.
5. **XAF1 methylation and IDH1 mutations**: The second abstract indicates that XAF1 promoter methylation is strongly associated with IDH1 mutations in high-grade gliomas. IDH1 mutations can influence the epigenetic landscape and potentially affect the expression of genes involved in temozolomide resistance.

By connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed:

Temozolomide treatment may lead to the activation of XAF1, which in turn interacts with IRF1, enhancing its activity and promoting a stress-induced apoptotic response. However, if XAF1 is epigenetically silenced through promoter methylation, which is associated with IDH1 mutations, the XAF1-IRF1 feedback loop may be disrupted, leading to reduced IRF1 activity and potentially contributing to temozolomide resistance. Additionally, the epigenetic regulation of MGMT and other genes involved in temozolomide resistance may also influence the activity of IRF1 and its downstream targets, including XAF1.

This proposed mechanism highlights the complex interplay between temozolomide, XAF1, IRF1, and epigenetic regulation in glioblastoma cells, and suggests that the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, may be influenced by multiple factors, including XAF1 expression, IDH1 mutations, and epigenetic modifications.",35.40808725357056,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '32901889', 'added': '16222105'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",32901889,16222105

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy.

The connection involves several steps and entities, including XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, and the role of interferons in gene expression.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and XAF1**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat glioblastoma, and resistance to TMZ is a significant challenge. XAF1 emerges as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ. This means that XAF1 plays a role in how glioblastoma cells develop resistance to temozolomide.

2. **XAF1 and Its Role**: The second abstract further explores XAF1, stating that it is a tumor suppressor that counteracts anti-apoptotic effects and can sensitize cells to cell death. The methylation status of XAF1's promoter is inversely correlated with its mRNA expression, and this methylation is associated with improved clinical outcomes in high-grade gliomas. This suggests that XAF1's activity is crucial in the context of glioblastoma and its treatment.

3. **IRF1 and Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs)**: The fifth abstract introduces IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) and its role in enhancing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when interferon alpha and gamma are co-administered. Among the ISGs whose transcription is enhanced is XAF1. This indicates that IRF1 can influence the expression of XAF1 through its role in the interferon signaling pathway.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: Connecting these elements, we can propose an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human. Temozolomide treatment can lead to the development of resistance in glioblastoma cells, a process in which XAF1 is involved. IRF1, through its role in the interferon signaling pathway, can influence the expression of XAF1. Therefore, IRF1 could indirectly affect the sensitivity or resistance of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide by regulating XAF1 expression. This relationship suggests that the activity of IRF1, influenced by interferon signaling, could impact the effectiveness of temozolomide treatment by modulating the levels or activity of XAF1, a protein involved in resistance mechanisms.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is mediated through XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein whose expression can be influenced by IRF1 in the context of interferon signaling. This relationship highlights the complex interplay between signaling pathways, gene expression, and drug resistance in cancer treatment.",28.589507579803467,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

MR visualization of the insula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made possible non-invasive research on the living human brain. However, three-dimensional display of areas obscured by the operculum deep within the cortex has been difficult. This study used MRI in an attempt to establish a three-dimensional method of displaying an obscured brain structure (the insula). A three-dimensional image of the insular cortex was constructed from horizontal MR images. As a result, the major anatomical landmarks of the insula were clearly displayed. This method makes possible non-invasive display and analysis of obscured structures deep in the brain, overcoming the disadvantage presented by the use of sectional images.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370', '16222105'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

The key findings and underlying mechanisms suggest the following narrative:

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and TROY Signaling**: Temozolomide is a standard chemotherapy drug used to treat glioblastoma. However, resistance to temozolomide is a significant challenge. The TROY signaling pathway, which interacts with JAK1-STAT3, has been identified as a factor that promotes glioblastoma cell migration and resistance to temozolomide. Inhibiting JAK1 activity using ruxolitinib can reduce TROY-induced STAT3 activation and decrease resistance to temozolomide.

2. **Ruxolitinib and Its Effects**: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, has been shown to interact with other drugs, such as dimethyl fumarate (DMF), to kill tumor cells, including those resistant to standard therapies like temozolomide. The combination of ruxolitinib and DMF can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to tumor cell death.

3. **IRF1 and Its Regulation**: IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses and can be induced by interferons. In the context of cancer, IRF1 has been implicated in the regulation of PD-L1 expression, a protein that helps cancer cells evade the immune system. The expression of IRF1 can be regulated by various signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT pathway.

4. **Connection between Temozolomide, JAK/STAT, and IRF1**: While there is no direct link between temozolomide and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred. Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells can be mediated by the TROY signaling pathway, which activates the JAK1-STAT3 pathway. The JAK/STAT pathway can, in turn, regulate the expression of IRF1, which is involved in the regulation of PD-L1. Therefore, inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway using ruxolitinib could potentially reduce IRF1 expression and subsequently affect PD-L1 levels, influencing the tumor's ability to evade the immune system.

5. **Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) and IRF1**: Another abstract mentions that EGCG, a component of green tea, can inhibit the IFN-γ pathway and reduce the expression of IRF1, leading to decreased PD-L1 expression. This suggests that EGCG could be used to modulate IRF1 expression and potentially enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, involves the following steps:

- Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells is mediated by the TROY signaling pathway, which activates the JAK1-STAT3 pathway.
- The JAK/STAT pathway regulates IRF1 expression, which is involved in PD-L1 regulation.
- Inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway using ruxolitinib or other agents could reduce IRF1 expression and subsequently affect PD-L1 levels, influencing the tumor's ability to evade the immune system.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0069197', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '17102778', 'added': '2418942'}",1,"('C0069197', 'C1530270')",17102778,2418942

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract mentions that TROY, an orphan receptor, increases resistance to temozolomide in glioblastoma cells. TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote cell migration and resistance.
2. **JAK1-STAT3 signaling**: The second abstract shows that ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, can interact with dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells, including glioblastoma cells. Ruxolitinib inhibits STAT3 activation, which is downstream of JAK1.
3. **IRF1 regulation by STAT1**: The fifth abstract reveals that EGF induces STAT1 expression, which in turn regulates IRF1, a transcription factor involved in the PD-L1 axis. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib decreases STAT1 and IRF1 levels.
4. **IRF1 inhibition by EGCG**: The sixth abstract demonstrates that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation, leading to the downregulation of IRF1 expression. This results in the inhibition of HLA-DR and HLA-B expression.

Connecting these elements, we can propose an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human:

Temozolomide → TROY (increased resistance) → JAK1-STAT3 signaling (promoting resistance) → STAT1 activation (regulated by EGF) → IRF1 expression (regulated by STAT1)

In this narrative, temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells is mediated by TROY, which activates JAK1-STAT3 signaling. This signaling pathway can be inhibited by ruxolitinib, which in turn affects STAT1 activation. STAT1 regulates IRF1 expression, which is involved in the PD-L1 axis. EGCG can inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation, leading to the downregulation of IRF1 expression.

While this relationship is indirect and involves multiple intermediate entities and processes, it highlights the complex interplay between signaling pathways and transcription factors in cancer cells. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting IRF1 and related pathways in glioblastoma.",31.69631314277649,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '20706757', '4300795', '21066565'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '20706757', 'added': '17097370'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",20706757,17097370

The key findings and underlying mechanisms from the abstracts can be linked as follows:

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and TROY Signaling**: The first abstract discusses how TROY signaling through JAK1-STAT3 promotes glioblastoma cell migration and resistance to temozolomide. This indicates that temozolomide's effectiveness can be influenced by signaling pathways involving JAK1 and STAT3.

2. **JAK1 Inhibition and IRF1**: The fifth abstract mentions that the blockade of EGFR by afatinib results in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels. This suggests a connection between JAK1/STAT signaling and IRF-1 expression. Since IRF-1 is a transcription factor involved in interferon signaling and can influence various cellular processes including immune responses and cell growth, its downregulation could impact the cellular response to temozolomide.

3. **Ruxolitinib's Role**: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is mentioned in several abstracts. It inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation, which is crucial for the IFNγ-mediated PD-L1 axis. Given that PD-L1 expression can influence tumor immune evasion, the inhibition of this axis could potentially enhance the effectiveness of temozolomide by modifying the tumor microenvironment.

4. **IRF1 and Immune Response**: IRF1 plays a role in regulating immune responses, including the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules like HLA-DR and HLA-B, as mentioned in the sixth abstract. The inhibition of IRF-1 could therefore impact the immune recognition of tumor cells, potentially affecting how tumors respond to treatments like temozolomide.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could exist through the following pathway:

- Temozolomide's efficacy is influenced by the tumor's resistance mechanisms, which can involve signaling pathways like JAK1-STAT3.
- The JAK1-STAT pathway can influence IRF-1 expression, potentially through the action of inhibitors like ruxolitinib on STAT1 phosphorylation.
- IRF-1, in turn, plays a role in immune response regulation, including the expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation (e.g., HLA-DR and HLA-B).
- The modulation of IRF-1 expression or activity could therefore impact the tumor microenvironment, affecting how tumors respond to temozolomide, either by altering immune recognition or by modifying intrinsic cellular resistance mechanisms.

This narrative illustrates how temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be indirectly related through signaling pathways and immune response mechanisms, highlighting the complexity of interactions in the tumor microenvironment and the potential for targeting these pathways to enhance therapeutic efficacy.",35.40808725357056,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '32901889', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '32901889', 'added': '16222105'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C0069197')",32901889,16222105

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy.

The key findings and mechanisms from the relevant abstracts can be linked as follows:

1. **Temozolomide and Cancer Treatment**: Temozolomide is a drug used in cancer treatment, particularly for brain tumors like glioblastoma. It works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and causing cell death.

2. **Ruxolitinib and Its Effects**: Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that has been shown to synergize with other drugs, including dimethyl fumarate (DMF), to kill cancer cells. This combination can lead to the inactivation of various signaling pathways (e.g., ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3, and STAT5) that are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation.

3. **STAT1 and IRF1 Connection**: The abstracts mention that EGF (epidermal growth factor) can induce STAT1 expression, which in turn can exacerbate the IFNγ-mediated PD-L1 axis in EGFR-positive cancers. IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is known to be involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression, often in conjunction with STAT1. The blockade of EGFR or the inhibition of JAK1/2 (using ruxolitinib) can decrease STAT1 and IRF1 levels, thereby reducing PD-L1 expression.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: Given that temozolomide can enhance the lethality of combinations including ruxolitinib (as seen in the first abstract), and considering ruxolitinib's role in inhibiting JAK1/2, which in turn can affect STAT1 and IRF1 expression (as indicated in the fifth abstract), an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed. Temozolomide, by enhancing the effects of ruxolitinib in killing cancer cells, could indirectly influence the expression or activity of IRF1 by modulating the signaling pathways that ruxolitinib affects, such as the JAK/STAT pathway.

5. **Mechanism**: The mechanism could involve temozolomide increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to the effects of ruxolitinib, leading to enhanced inhibition of JAK1/2. This inhibition reduces STAT1 phosphorylation and expression, which in turn could decrease IRF1 expression or activity, given their interconnected roles in the IFNγ signaling pathway and the regulation of PD-L1.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is based on temozolomide's ability to enhance the lethality of drug combinations that include JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib's inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway can lead to decreased expression or activity of IRF1, thereby establishing an indirect link between temozolomide treatment and IRF1 modulation in cancer cells.",28.589507579803467,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

MR visualization of the insula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made possible non-invasive research on the living human brain. However, three-dimensional display of areas obscured by the operculum deep within the cortex has been difficult. This study used MRI in an attempt to establish a three-dimensional method of displaying an obscured brain structure (the insula). A three-dimensional image of the insular cortex was constructed from horizontal MR images. As a result, the major anatomical landmarks of the insula were clearly displayed. This method makes possible non-invasive display and analysis of obscured structures deep in the brain, overcoming the disadvantage presented by the use of sectional images.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.","{('C0076080', 'C0069197'): ['19514084', '4300795', '21066565', '17097370', '16222105'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '7199054', '2418942']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

1. **Temozolomide and ERBB2 signaling**: Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including gliomas and melanomas. ERBB2 (also known as HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival. In the abstract ""A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma,"" lapatinib, an ERBB2 inhibitor, is combined with temozolomide to target ERBB2-overexpressing ependymomas. This suggests that temozolomide may indirectly affect ERBB2 signaling.

2. **ERBB2 signaling and IRF1**: IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell growth. In the abstract ""Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis,"" IRF1 is shown to be upregulated in response to sublytic C5b-9, leading to apoptosis in glomerular mesangial cells. Additionally, in the abstract ""IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract,"" IRF1 is mentioned as a downstream target of IFN-γ, which is involved in the regulation of immune responses. ERBB2 signaling has been shown to intersect with IRF1 signaling in various contexts, including cancer. For example, ERBB2 can activate the MAPK/ERK pathway, which can phosphorylate and activate IRF1.

3. **Temozolomide, methionine deprivation, and IRF1**: In the abstract ""Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress,"" methionine deprivation stress is shown to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells and sensitize them to temozolomide. IRF1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and can be induced by various forms of cellular stress, including methionine deprivation. Therefore, it is possible that temozolomide, through its effects on methionine metabolism or other cellular stress pathways, indirectly regulates IRF1 expression or activity.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following pathway:

Temozolomide → ERBB2 signaling (inhibition or modulation) → IRF1 signaling (activation or regulation) → Apoptosis, immune responses, or other cellular processes

This proposed relationship is based on the connections between temozolomide, ERBB2 signaling, and IRF1 signaling, as well as the effects of methionine deprivation stress on IRF1 expression and apoptosis. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this indirect relationship.",34.983481645584106,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['31575897', '11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '31575897', 'added': '9123001'}",1,"('C1337027', 'C0069197')",31575897,9123001

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

1. **Temozolomide and ERBB2**: Temozolomide is used in the treatment of various cancers, including those with ERBB2 overexpression. The study on ""A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma"" suggests that temozolomide, in combination with lapatinib (an ERBB2 inhibitor), can be effective in treating ependymomas. This implies that temozolomide's efficacy might be influenced by ERBB2 expression.

2. **ERBB2 and IRF1**: The study ""Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis"" shows that IRF1 is involved in a signaling pathway that leads to apoptosis in glomerular mesangial cells. Another study, ""miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling,"" indicates that ERBB2 signaling can be modulated by miR-296-5p, affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma. Although this study does not directly link ERBB2 to IRF1, it suggests that ERBB2 signaling pathways can influence various cellular processes, potentially including those involving IRF1.

3. **Temozolomide, Methionine Deprivation, and IRF1**: The abstract ""Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress"" discusses how methionine deprivation stress (MDS) can sensitize melanoma cells to temozolomide. While this study does not directly mention IRF1, it implies that stress responses, potentially involving IRF1 (given its role in stress and immune responses), could modulate the efficacy of temozolomide.

4. **IRF1 and Stress Responses**: IRF1 is known to be involved in interferon signaling and can be induced by various forms of cellular stress. The study ""IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract"" shows that IFNγ, which can induce IRF1, plays a role in controlling the development of certain syndromes, highlighting the complex interplay between immune responses and tissue damage.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could exist through the modulation of ERBB2 signaling and the induction of stress responses. Temozolomide's efficacy in cancer treatment might be influenced by the ERBB2 status of the tumor, and ERBB2 signaling could, in turn, affect IRF1 expression or activity, either directly or through the modulation of cellular stress responses and interferon signaling pathways. Additionally, the sensitization of cancer cells to temozolomide by methionine deprivation stress could involve IRF1, given its role in stress responses and apoptosis. This proposed relationship highlights the complexity of cancer biology and the potential for multiple, indirect pathways influencing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents like temozolomide.",36.60644602775574,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '28122345', 'added': '10155955'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",28122345,10155955

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide and Methionine Deprivation Stress (MDS)**: Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been shown to be effective in treating various types of cancer, including glioblastoma and melanoma. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) has been found to sensitize cancer cells to temozolomide. MDS induces mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and increases the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, making cancer cells more susceptible to temozolomide.

2. **MDS, ERBB2, and IRF1**: MDS has been shown to down-regulate the expression of ERBB2, a gene involved in cell proliferation and survival. IRF1, a transcription factor, is known to be involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The down-regulation of ERBB2 by MDS may lead to the up-regulation of IRF1, as IRF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that can inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis.

3. **ERBB2 and IRF1**: ERBB2 has been found to be involved in the regulation of IRF1 expression. The inhibition of ERBB2 signaling can lead to the up-regulation of IRF1, which in turn can induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth.

4. **IRF1 and Apoptosis**: IRF1 is a key regulator of apoptosis, and its up-regulation can lead to the induction of pro-apoptotic genes, such as TRADD and caspase 8. The activation of these genes can ultimately lead to apoptosis.

5. **Temozolomide and IRF1**: Temozolomide can induce the expression of IRF1, which can lead to the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth. The combination of temozolomide and MDS may synergistically enhance the expression of IRF1, leading to increased apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following pathway: temozolomide → MDS → ERBB2 down-regulation → IRF1 up-regulation → apoptosis.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '24214988', 'added': '20645777'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",24214988,20645777

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Temozolomide and Methionine Deprivation Stress (MDS):** Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including gliomas and melanomas. The abstract on ""Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress"" suggests that MDS can sensitize cancer cells to temozolomide. This implies that temozolomide's efficacy might be enhanced in conditions where methionine metabolism is altered.

2. **Methionine Metabolism and ERBB2 Signaling:** The same abstract mentions that MDS affects the expression of various genes, including those involved in the ERBB2 signaling pathway. ERBB2 (also known as HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when overexpressed or mutated, can contribute to oncogenesis in several cancer types.

3. **ERBB2 Signaling and IRF1:** The abstract ""Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis"" introduces IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) as part of a signaling cascade involved in apoptosis. While this abstract does not directly link ERBB2 to IRF1, other studies (not included in the provided abstracts but part of the broader scientific literature) have shown that interferon signaling pathways, which IRF1 is a part of, can intersect with growth factor receptor signaling pathways, including ERBB2. For instance, interferons can modulate the expression and activity of various receptors and their ligands, potentially influencing ERBB2 signaling indirectly.

4. **Temozolomide, ERBB2, and IRF1:** Connecting the dots, temozolomide's action in sensitizing cells to apoptosis, potentially through pathways that involve methionine metabolism and ERBB2 signaling, could indirectly influence IRF1 expression or activity. If ERBB2 signaling is altered in response to temozolomide treatment (either directly or through MDS), and given that ERBB2 signaling can intersect with interferon pathways, it's conceivable that IRF1 could be indirectly affected. This could occur through changes in the cellular environment that influence IRF1's role in apoptosis, immune response, or cell cycle regulation.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could exist through a complex interplay involving methionine deprivation stress, ERBB2 signaling, and the broader network of cellular pathways that respond to chemotherapy and metabolic stress. Temozolomide's effects on cancer cells, particularly through sensitization to apoptosis and potential modulation of ERBB2 signaling, could indirectly influence IRF1's functions, given the interconnectedness of signaling pathways within cells. However, this proposed relationship is speculative and based on the connections made between the provided abstracts, highlighting the need for direct experimental evidence to confirm such interactions.",32.257681131362915,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Evaluation of Bauhinia monandra aqueous and ethanol extracts in pregnant rats. Bauhinia monandra Kurz. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) is a plant widely employed in Brazilian folk medicine for hypoglycemia. However, little is known about the effect of maternal exposure to this plant on fetal development. The aqueous and ethanol extracts obtained from B. monandra dried leaves were administered to pregnant Wistar rats throughout gestation (day 1 to day 20) at 1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group). Maternal toxicity was not observed in the dams of both groups, and was evaluated by observing body weight, water and food intake during treatment, by measuring serum biochemical levels of creatinine, urea, AST and ALT, and by studying the histopathology of liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen and uterus at the end of treatment (gestation day 20). Both extracts and doses did not impair reproductive performance or delay fetal development, measured by observing implantations and reabsorptions in the uterus, by counting the number of corpora lutea in ovaries, by recording the litter weight and number of live and dead fetuses and by analyzing possible skeleton and viscera malformations in the fetuses. Also, the aqueous extract promoted decreased post-implantation loss when compared to the control group. The aqueous and ethanol extracts from B. monandra dried leaves (1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day) did not cause maternal or fetal toxicities and the aqueous extract promoted increased implantation and decreased post-implantation loss in the pregnant rats.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955', '20645777'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, and decreased expression of TOP2A.

2. **Cell quiescence and temozolomide resistance**: The second abstract shows that quiescent glioblastoma cells are more resistant to temozolomide and have enhanced invasive potential. This quiescent state is associated with the expression of specific genes, including TGFBI, IGFBP3, and CHI3L1.

3. **IGFBP3 and IRF1**: The fifth abstract mentions that IGFBP3 is up-regulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) in the mouse uterus, and that IRF1 is associated with the regulation of IGFBP3 expression. Although this abstract does not directly link IGFBP3 to IRF1 in humans, it suggests a potential connection between IGFBP3 and IRF1 in other contexts.

4. **IRF1 and interferon signaling**: The eighth abstract discusses the role of IRF1 in regulating gene expression in response to interferon tau (IFNT) in bovine endometrial cells. This suggests that IRF1 is involved in interferon signaling pathways, which can influence gene expression and cellular behavior.

5. **Interferon signaling and temozolomide resistance**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided abstracts, interferon signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma. For example, interferon-beta has been shown to enhance the anti-tumor effects of temozolomide in glioblastoma cells.

By connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed:

Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma → increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, and decreased expression of TOP2A → quiescent cell state → expression of IGFBP3 and other genes associated with quiescence → potential regulation of IGFBP3 by IRF1 → IRF1 involvement in interferon signaling pathways → interferon signaling pathways influencing temozolomide resistance.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['31575897', '11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '31575897', 'added': '9123001'}",1,"('C1337027', 'C0069197')",31575897,9123001

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, which are known to promote stemness and invasiveness in glioma cells.
2. **Cell quiescence and temozolomide resistance**: The second abstract shows that cell quiescence correlates with enhanced glioblastoma cell invasion and cytotoxic resistance, including resistance to temozolomide. Quiescent cells exhibit a distinct gene expression profile, including upregulation of genes involved in cell invasion and migration, such as TGFBI, IGFBP3, and CHI3L1.
3. **IGFBP3 and IRF1**: The sixth abstract mentions that IGFBP3 is upregulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) in the mouse uterus, and the eighth abstract shows that IGFBP3 is associated with IRF-6 in bovine endometrial cells. IRF1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of various genes involved in immune responses and cell growth. Although there is no direct link between IGFBP3 and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, it is possible that IGFBP3 regulates IRF1 expression or activity indirectly, perhaps through its effects on cell growth and differentiation.
4. **IRF1 and cell growth regulation**: The tenth abstract mentions that IRF1 is involved in regulating the macrophage-specific promoters of the human and mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) genes. IRF1 may also play a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in other cell types, including glioblastoma cells.
5. **Temozolomide and IRF1**: Although there is no direct link between temozolomide and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, it is possible that temozolomide affects IRF1 expression or activity indirectly, perhaps through its effects on cell growth and differentiation. For example, temozolomide may induce cell stress responses that activate IRF1, leading to changes in gene expression that promote cell survival or resistance to therapy.

In summary, the proposed indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, involves the following steps:

Temozolomide → Resistance in glioblastoma cells → Cell quiescence → Upregulation of IGFBP3 → Regulation of IRF1 expression or activity → Changes in cell growth and differentiation

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets.

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, which are known to promote stemness and tumorigenicity.
2. **IGFBP3 as a mediator of temozolomide resistance**: The second abstract shows that quiescent glioblastoma cells, which are more resistant to temozolomide, have increased expression of IGFBP3. IGFBP3 is a protein that binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and regulates their activity. Elevated IGFBP3 levels may contribute to temozolomide resistance by promoting cell survival and stemness.
3. **IRF1 regulation of IGFBP3**: The sixth abstract mentions that IRF1, a transcription factor, regulates the expression of IGFBP3 in bovine endometrial cells. IRF1 binding sites are found in the promoter region of the IGFBP3 gene, suggesting that IRF1 may directly regulate IGFBP3 expression.
4. **IRF1 as a tumor suppressor**: IRF1 is known to have tumor-suppressive functions, and its expression is often downregulated in cancer cells. The eighth abstract shows that IRF1 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation, including the c-fms gene, which is involved in macrophage differentiation.
5. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Based on these findings, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 can be proposed. Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells may be associated with increased expression of IGFBP3, which is regulated by IRF1. Downregulation of IRF1 in cancer cells may contribute to increased IGFBP3 expression, promoting temozolomide resistance. Therefore, IRF1 may play a role in regulating the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide, albeit indirectly through its regulation of IGFBP3.

In summary, the proposed indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 involves the following steps:

Temozolomide resistance → Increased IGFBP3 expression → IRF1 regulation of IGFBP3 → IRF1 tumor-suppressive functions

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '24214988', 'added': '20645777'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",24214988,20645777

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of glioma is poorly characterized. XAF1 activation by temozolomide (TMZ) and its effect on TMZ cytotoxicity were defined using luciferase reporter, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Signaling mechanism was analyzed using genetic and pharmacologic experiments. In vivo studies were performed in mice to validate the role of XAF1 in TMZ therapy. Epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in cell lines and primary tumors and contributes to cancer cell growth. XAF1 transcription is activated by TMZ via JNK-IRF-1 signaling to promote apoptosis while it is impaired by promoter hypermethylation. In tumor cells expressing high O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), XAF1 response to TMZ is debilitated. XAF1 facilitates TMZ-mediated autophagic flux to direct an apoptotic transition of protective autophagy. Mechanistically, XAF1 is translocated into the mitochondria to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.

Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, which are known to promote stemness and invasiveness in glioma cells.
2. **Quiescent glioblastoma cells**: The second abstract shows that quiescent glioblastoma cells, which are characterized by low proliferative capacity, are more resistant to temozolomide and exhibit enhanced invasive potential. This suggests that quiescent cells may be a key population that contributes to temozolomide resistance.
3. **IGFBP3 expression**: The second abstract also identifies IGFBP3 as a gene that is overexpressed in quiescent glioblastoma cells. IGFBP3 is a protein that binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and regulates their activity.
4. **IRF1 regulation**: The eighth abstract mentions that IRF1, a transcription factor, regulates the expression of IGFBP3 in bovine endometrial cells. This suggests that IRF1 may also play a role in regulating IGFBP3 expression in other cell types, including glioblastoma cells.
5. **Temozolomide-induced changes in IRF1 expression**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, it is possible that temozolomide treatment may induce changes in IRF1 expression, which in turn affects IGFBP3 expression and contributes to temozolomide resistance.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human may involve the following sequence of events:

Temozolomide treatment → Selection of quiescent glioblastoma cells → Increased expression of IGFBP3 → Regulation of IGFBP3 by IRF1 → Modulation of IRF1 expression by temozolomide → Altered IRF1 activity → Changes in IGFBP3 expression → Temozolomide resistance

This narrative is speculative and requires further experimental validation to confirm the relationships between these entities. However, it provides a possible framework for understanding the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.",32.257681131362915,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Evaluation of Bauhinia monandra aqueous and ethanol extracts in pregnant rats. Bauhinia monandra Kurz. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) is a plant widely employed in Brazilian folk medicine for hypoglycemia. However, little is known about the effect of maternal exposure to this plant on fetal development. The aqueous and ethanol extracts obtained from B. monandra dried leaves were administered to pregnant Wistar rats throughout gestation (day 1 to day 20) at 1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group). Maternal toxicity was not observed in the dams of both groups, and was evaluated by observing body weight, water and food intake during treatment, by measuring serum biochemical levels of creatinine, urea, AST and ALT, and by studying the histopathology of liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen and uterus at the end of treatment (gestation day 20). Both extracts and doses did not impair reproductive performance or delay fetal development, measured by observing implantations and reabsorptions in the uterus, by counting the number of corpora lutea in ovaries, by recording the litter weight and number of live and dead fetuses and by analyzing possible skeleton and viscera malformations in the fetuses. Also, the aqueous extract promoted decreased post-implantation loss when compared to the control group. The aqueous and ethanol extracts from B. monandra dried leaves (1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day) did not cause maternal or fetal toxicities and the aqueous extract promoted increased implantation and decreased post-implantation loss in the pregnant rats.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955', '20645777'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Here's a possible narrative that connects the key findings and underlying mechanisms:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and serotonin**: Dextroamphetamine is known to increase the release of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, which can lead to enhanced serotonergic activity. This is evident from the abstracts that discuss the effects of dextroamphetamine on serotonin syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive serotonergic activity.
2. **Cyproheptadine and serotonin**: Cyproheptadine is a serotonin receptor antagonist that can block the effects of excessive serotonergic activity. In the abstracts, cyproheptadine is used to treat serotonin syndrome, and it is also shown to interact with dextroamphetamine, potentially modifying its effects.
3. **Linezolid and serotonin**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, is a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase enzymes, which can lead to increased levels of serotonin in the brain. This is evident from the abstracts that report cases of serotonin syndrome in patients taking linezolid, particularly when combined with other serotonergic agents.
4. **Indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid**: Given that both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can increase serotonergic activity, it is possible that their concurrent use could lead to excessive serotonin levels, potentially resulting in serotonin syndrome. Although there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, their indirect relationship is mediated by their effects on the serotonergic system.

The intermediate entities or processes involved in this indirect relationship include:

* **Serotonin (5-HT)**: The neurotransmitter that is affected by both dextroamphetamine and linezolid, leading to enhanced serotonergic activity.
* **Cyproheptadine**: A serotonin receptor antagonist that can block the effects of excessive serotonergic activity, potentially modifying the interactions between dextroamphetamine and linezolid.
* **Monoamine oxidase enzymes**: The enzymes that are inhibited by linezolid, leading to increased levels of serotonin in the brain.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is mediated by their effects on the serotonergic system, particularly through their ability to increase serotonin levels in the brain. This relationship is influenced by intermediate entities, such as cyproheptadine and monoamine oxidase enzymes, which can modify the interactions between these two substances.",34.983481645584106,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['31575897', '11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '31575897', 'added': '9123001'}",1,"('C1337027', 'C0069197')",31575897,9123001

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Dextroamphetamine is known to affect serotonin levels and activity in the brain, and linezolid, an antibiotic, has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, when used concomitantly with serotonergic agents.

The key findings that suggest an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid are:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on serotonin**: Studies have shown that dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release and inhibit its reuptake, leading to increased serotonergic activity in the brain.
2. **Linezolid's interaction with serotonergic agents**: Linezolid has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome when used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and other serotonergic agents.
3. **Serotonin syndrome as a common link**: Both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome, although through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonergic activity, while linezolid can inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, leading to increased serotonin levels.

The underlying mechanisms that might contribute to an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid include:

1. **Increased serotonergic activity**: Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release and inhibit its reuptake, leading to increased serotonergic activity in the brain. If linezolid is used concomitantly, it may further increase serotonin levels, potentially leading to serotonin syndrome.
2. **Inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes**: Linezolid can inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, which are responsible for breaking down serotonin. If dextroamphetamine is used concomitantly, it may increase serotonin release, and the inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes by linezolid may lead to increased serotonin levels, potentially causing serotonin syndrome.

Intermediate entities or processes that might be involved in the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid include:

1. **Cyproheptadine**: Cyproheptadine is a serotonin receptor antagonist that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome. It has been shown to interact with dextroamphetamine, reducing its self-administration in rats. Cyproheptadine may also be used to treat serotonin syndrome caused by linezolid.
2. **Serotonergic agents**: Other serotonergic agents, such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may interact with dextroamphetamine and linezolid, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system, particularly their potential to increase serotonergic activity and contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome. The use of dextroamphetamine and linezolid concomitantly may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, and caution should be exercised when prescribing these medications together.",36.60644602775574,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '28122345', 'added': '10155955'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",28122345,10155955

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

Dextroamphetamine is known to affect serotonin levels and activity in the brain, and linezolid, an antibiotic, has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, when used in combination with serotonergic agents.

The key findings that suggest an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid are:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on serotonin**: Studies have shown that dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release and inhibit its reuptake, leading to increased serotonergic activity in the brain.
2. **Linezolid's interaction with serotonergic agents**: Linezolid has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome when used in combination with serotonergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and fentanyl.
3. **Cyproheptadine's role in treating serotonin syndrome**: Cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is often used to treat serotonin syndrome. Interestingly, cyproheptadine has also been shown to affect dextroamphetamine's behavioral effects, suggesting a potential link between the two substances.

The underlying mechanisms that might contribute to an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid are:

1. **Serotonergic system modulation**: Both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can modulate the serotonergic system, although through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine increases serotonin release and inhibits its reuptake, while linezolid can inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, leading to increased serotonin levels.
2. **Interactions with other serotonergic agents**: Both substances can interact with other serotonergic agents, such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and fentanyl, which can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Intermediate entities or processes that might be involved in the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid include:

1. **Serotonin receptor antagonists**: Cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, might play a role in treating serotonin syndrome caused by linezolid and could also affect dextroamphetamine's behavioral effects.
2. **Monoamine oxidase enzymes**: Linezolid's inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes could contribute to increased serotonin levels, which might interact with dextroamphetamine's effects on the serotonergic system.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system, particularly their effects on serotonin levels and activity. The use of dextroamphetamine in combination with linezolid could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, and cyproheptadine might play a role in treating this condition. However, further research is needed to fully understand the nature of this indirect relationship.",30.89449143409729,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '24214988', 'added': '20645777'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",24214988,20645777

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

The connection between these two substances is not direct but rather mediated through their interactions with the serotonergic system and the potential for inducing serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin**: Dextroamphetamine is known to affect the central nervous system, including influencing serotonin levels and activity. The abstracts suggest that dextroamphetamine's effects can be modulated by serotonergic agents. For instance, the administration of certain serotonergic antagonists can alter the behavioral responses to dextroamphetamine in animal models.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, is associated with the risk of inducing serotonin syndrome, particularly when used in conjunction with serotonergic agents. This is because linezolid has monoamine oxidase inhibiting properties, which can lead to increased levels of serotonin in the brain.

3. **Serotonin Syndrome as a Mediator**: The critical link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is the potential for both to influence serotonin levels, albeit through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release or affect its reuptake, while linezolid can inhibit the breakdown of serotonin by acting as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be hypothesized as follows: If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine and then starts linezolid therapy, the combination could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome due to the synergistic effects on the serotonergic system. Dextroamphetamine could enhance serotonin release or block its reuptake, while linezolid could reduce serotonin breakdown, leading to excessively high serotonin levels and potentially inducing serotonin syndrome.

5. **Clinical Implications**: This indirect relationship highlights the importance of careful medication management and monitoring when patients are prescribed drugs that can affect the serotonergic system, especially when combining substances like dextroamphetamine with linezolid or other serotonergic agents.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is mediated through their effects on the serotonergic system, with both substances having the potential to contribute to elevated serotonin levels and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when used together. This relationship underscores the need for cautious prescribing practices and close monitoring of patients on these medications to prevent adverse interactions.",32.257681131362915,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Evaluation of Bauhinia monandra aqueous and ethanol extracts in pregnant rats. Bauhinia monandra Kurz. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) is a plant widely employed in Brazilian folk medicine for hypoglycemia. However, little is known about the effect of maternal exposure to this plant on fetal development. The aqueous and ethanol extracts obtained from B. monandra dried leaves were administered to pregnant Wistar rats throughout gestation (day 1 to day 20) at 1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group). Maternal toxicity was not observed in the dams of both groups, and was evaluated by observing body weight, water and food intake during treatment, by measuring serum biochemical levels of creatinine, urea, AST and ALT, and by studying the histopathology of liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen and uterus at the end of treatment (gestation day 20). Both extracts and doses did not impair reproductive performance or delay fetal development, measured by observing implantations and reabsorptions in the uterus, by counting the number of corpora lutea in ovaries, by recording the litter weight and number of live and dead fetuses and by analyzing possible skeleton and viscera malformations in the fetuses. Also, the aqueous extract promoted decreased post-implantation loss when compared to the control group. The aqueous and ethanol extracts from B. monandra dried leaves (1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day) did not cause maternal or fetal toxicities and the aqueous extract promoted increased implantation and decreased post-implantation loss in the pregnant rats.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955', '20645777'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Here's a possible narrative connecting the key findings and mechanisms:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on the dopaminergic system**: Dextroamphetamine is a dopaminergic agent that increases dopamine levels in the brain. The second abstract mentions that D-amphetamine (the same as dextroamphetamine) stimulates locomotor activity in mice, which is modulated by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. This receptor subtype is involved in regulating dopamine and serotonin metabolism in the striatum.

2. **Serotonin syndrome and linezolid**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, can inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin and other biogenic amines. When linezolid is co-administered with serotonergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), it can lead to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. This is because the inhibition of MAO by linezolid can cause an accumulation of serotonin in the brain, which can be exacerbated by the concurrent use of serotonergic agents.

3. **Indirect link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid**: Although dextroamphetamine primarily affects the dopaminergic system, it can also indirectly influence the serotonergic system. The first abstract mentions that atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, can cause dyskinesias when combined with dopaminergic agents like dextroamphetamine. Additionally, the third abstract shows that D-amphetamine can affect the serotonergic system, as it alters the response to fenfluramine-induced serotonergic syndrome in rats.

Considering these findings, it's possible that dextroamphetamine could increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when co-administered with linezolid, especially if the patient is also taking serotonergic agents. The mechanism might involve the following steps:

* Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine levels in the brain, which can indirectly affect the serotonergic system.
* Linezolid inhibits MAO, leading to an accumulation of serotonin.
* The combination of increased dopamine and serotonin can exacerbate the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly if the patient is taking other serotonergic agents.

While this narrative provides a possible indirect link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, it's essential to note that the relationship is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including individual patient characteristics, dosages, and concurrent medications. Further research is necessary to fully understand the potential interactions between these agents.",34.983481645584106,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['31575897', '11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C0069197'), 'dropped': '31575897', 'added': '9123001'}",1,"('C1337027', 'C0069197')",31575897,9123001

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Here's a possible narrative connecting the key findings and underlying mechanisms:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on the dopaminergic system**: Dextroamphetamine is a dopaminergic agent that increases dopamine levels in the brain. The second abstract mentions that D-amphetamine (the same as dextroamphetamine) stimulates locomotor activity in mice, which is modulated by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. This suggests that dextroamphetamine's effects on the dopaminergic system might be influenced by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype.

2. **Alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype's role in modulating serotonin and dopamine**: The second abstract also states that the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype modulates the metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. This implies that alterations in the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype could affect the balance between serotonin and dopamine in the brain.

3. **Linezolid's inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO)**: The linezolid-related abstracts mention that linezolid inhibits MAO, an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin, dopamine, and other biogenic amines. This inhibition can lead to increased levels of these neurotransmitters, potentially causing serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic agents.

4. **Potential interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid**: Although there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, the indirect relationship might arise from their effects on the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. Dextroamphetamine's increase in dopamine levels could potentially interact with linezolid's inhibition of MAO, leading to increased levels of both dopamine and serotonin. If the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype is involved in modulating this interaction, alterations in its expression or function could influence the risk of serotonin syndrome when combining dextroamphetamine with linezolid.

5. **Serotonin syndrome as a potential outcome**: The linezolid-related abstracts highlight the risk of serotonin syndrome when combining linezolid with serotonergic agents. If dextroamphetamine's effects on the dopaminergic system indirectly contribute to increased serotonin levels, the combination of dextroamphetamine and linezolid could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might arise from their interactions with the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, potentially modulated by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. While there is no direct evidence of a interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, their combined effects on neurotransmitter levels could increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction and closely monitor patients receiving dextroamphetamine and linezolid concurrently.",36.60644602775574,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '28122345', 'added': '10155955'}",2,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",28122345,10155955

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

The connection between these two substances is not direct but can be understood through their interactions with other entities and processes, particularly those involving neurotransmitter systems.

1. **Dextroamphetamine's Mechanism**: Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It does this by promoting the release of these neurotransmitters and inhibiting their reuptake.

2. **Linezolid's Interaction with Serotonin**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, has a secondary effect as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). MAOIs prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), leading to an increase in their concentrations in the brain. When linezolid is used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonergic agents, it can lead to an excessive accumulation of serotonin, potentially causing serotonin syndrome.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be hypothesized through their effects on neurotransmitter systems. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels, and while its primary action is not on the serotonin system, alterations in dopamine and norepinephrine can indirectly affect serotonin regulation due to the complex interactions between these neurotransmitter systems. For instance, increased dopamine can influence serotonin release and metabolism in certain parts of the brain.

4. **Alpha2C-Adrenoceptors**: The study on alpha2C-adrenoceptor subtypes suggests that these receptors modulate the metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. Dextroamphetamine's effects on dopamine could potentially be influenced by the activity of these receptors. If linezolid, through its MAOI activity, affects the serotonin system, and considering the interconnectedness of neurotransmitter systems, there could be an indirect influence on dopamine and norepinephrine systems as well.

5. **Clinical Implications**: The risk of serotonin syndrome with linezolid and SSRIs highlights the importance of monitoring drug interactions. While dextroamphetamine is not typically associated with serotonin syndrome directly, its use in combination with other drugs that affect serotonin levels (including linezolid) could potentially exacerbate risks due to its effects on other neurotransmitter systems that interact with serotonin.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid involves the complex interplay of neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Dextroamphetamine's effects on dopamine and norepinephrine, combined with linezolid's inhibition of monoamine oxidase (which affects serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), create a scenario where the use of these drugs together could potentially lead to unpredictable neurotransmitter imbalances. This relationship underscores the need for careful consideration of drug interactions and monitoring in clinical practice.",30.89449143409729,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '24214988', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1337027'), 'dropped': '24214988', 'added': '20645777'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C1337027')",24214988,20645777

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine's Mechanism**: Dextroamphetamine is a dopaminergic and noradrenergic medication, primarily used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain by promoting their release and inhibiting their reuptake.

2. **Linezolid's Mechanism**: Linezolid is an antibiotic that inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down monoamines such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. By inhibiting MAO, linezolid can increase the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain.

3. **Serotonin Syndrome**: The abstracts mention the risk of serotonin syndrome when linezolid is used with serotonergic agents. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive levels of serotonin in the body. It can occur when certain medications, including MAO inhibitors like linezolid, are taken together with drugs that increase serotonin levels.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be related to their effects on neurotransmitter levels. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels, and while it does not directly affect serotonin levels, its use in combination with other medications that influence serotonin could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with an MAO inhibitor like linezolid. 

5. **Intermediate Entities or Processes**: The key intermediate entity in this relationship is the increase in neurotransmitter levels, particularly serotonin, when linezolid is used with medications that have serotonergic properties. Dextroamphetamine, by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine, might not directly contribute to serotonin syndrome but could potentially exacerbate the condition in a complex drug interaction scenario involving serotonergic agents and linezolid.

6. **Alpha2C-Adrenergic Receptor Subtype**: The study on D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behaviors in mice with genetically altered expression of the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype suggests that this receptor plays a role in modulating dopamine and serotonin metabolism. The interaction between dextroamphetamine (a dopaminergic agent) and linezolid (an MAO inhibitor) could theoretically be influenced by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype, as it affects the balance of these neurotransmitters.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their potential to influence neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine, while linezolid, by inhibiting MAO, can increase serotonin levels. In a scenario where dextroamphetamine is used with other medications that affect serotonin, the addition of linezolid could potentially lead to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the cumulative effect on neurotransmitter levels. This relationship highlights the importance of careful drug interaction monitoring, especially when combining medications that can affect the brain's neurotransmitter balance.",32.257681131362915,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Evaluation of Bauhinia monandra aqueous and ethanol extracts in pregnant rats. Bauhinia monandra Kurz. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) is a plant widely employed in Brazilian folk medicine for hypoglycemia. However, little is known about the effect of maternal exposure to this plant on fetal development. The aqueous and ethanol extracts obtained from B. monandra dried leaves were administered to pregnant Wistar rats throughout gestation (day 1 to day 20) at 1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group). Maternal toxicity was not observed in the dams of both groups, and was evaluated by observing body weight, water and food intake during treatment, by measuring serum biochemical levels of creatinine, urea, AST and ALT, and by studying the histopathology of liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen and uterus at the end of treatment (gestation day 20). Both extracts and doses did not impair reproductive performance or delay fetal development, measured by observing implantations and reabsorptions in the uterus, by counting the number of corpora lutea in ovaries, by recording the litter weight and number of live and dead fetuses and by analyzing possible skeleton and viscera malformations in the fetuses. Also, the aqueous extract promoted decreased post-implantation loss when compared to the control group. The aqueous and ethanol extracts from B. monandra dried leaves (1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day) did not cause maternal or fetal toxicities and the aqueous extract promoted increased implantation and decreased post-implantation loss in the pregnant rats.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955', '20645777'], ('C1337027', 'C0069197'): ['11146369', '10311574', '8676002', '10981492', '9123001'], ('C0069197', 'C1530270'): ['16520149', '34932098', '33992628', '17102778', '7199054']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Although there is no direct mention of a relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid in the abstracts, we can infer a possible indirect linkage through the involvement of serotonergic mechanisms and the potential for serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin**: The first abstract discusses the differentiation of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine, highlighting that d-amphetamine-induced hyperthermia and hyperkinesia are influenced by serotonergic antagonists. This suggests that dextroamphetamine's effects are modulated by the serotonin system.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: The abstract on serotonin syndrome mentions that linezolid, an antibiotic, can cause serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents. This indicates that linezolid interacts with the serotonin system, potentially increasing serotonin levels or activity.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: Given that dextroamphetamine's effects are modulated by the serotonin system and linezolid can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome by interacting with serotonergic agents, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could exist through their shared interaction with the serotonin system. If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine (which affects serotonin levels or activity) and is then prescribed linezolid, there could be an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the combined effect on the serotonin system.

4. **Cyproheptadine as a Mediator**: The abstract on prophylactic treatment with cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome provides a potential mediator in this indirect relationship. Cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, can be used to prevent serotonin syndrome in patients at risk, such as those taking linezolid with other serotonergic agents. If dextroamphetamine is one of those agents, the use of cyproheptadine could mitigate the risk of serotonin syndrome, further illustrating the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid through their effects on the serotonin system.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their interactions with the serotonin system. Dextroamphetamine's neuropharmacological effects are influenced by serotonergic mechanisms, and linezolid increases the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic agents. This shared interaction with the serotonin system, potentially mediated by the use of serotonergic antagonists like cyproheptadine to prevent serotonin syndrome, forms the basis of their indirect relationship.",26.065773248672485,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases the levels of certain neurotransmitters, including serotonin, in the brain. Linezolid, an antibiotic, is also known to interact with the serotonergic system and can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents.

The abstract ""Serotonin Syndrome: Prophylactic Treatment With Cyproheptadine"" highlights the risk of serotonin syndrome associated with linezolid therapy, particularly when used in combination with other serotonergic agents. This suggests that linezolid can affect the serotonergic system, potentially leading to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

Although there is no direct mention of dextroamphetamine in the abstracts, its mechanism of action as a serotonergic agent could potentially interact with linezolid, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome. This indirect relationship is based on the shared interaction with the serotonergic system, rather than a direct pharmacological interaction between the two substances.

The underlying mechanism of this potential indirect relationship involves the modulation of serotonin levels in the brain. Dextroamphetamine increases serotonin levels, while linezolid can also affect the serotonergic system, potentially leading to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic agents.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their interactions with the serotonergic system, which could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when used together. This relationship is indirect, as there is no direct mention of dextroamphetamine in the abstracts, but it is plausible based on the mechanisms of action of both substances.",33.323835134506226,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C1530270'): ['16987558', '30042418', '16769855', '1999059', '8154526']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '30042418', 'added': '13431320'}",3,"('C1337027', 'C1530270')",30042418,13431320

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin Syndrome**: Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin levels in the brain. Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, it's known that dextroamphetamine, like other amphetamines, can have serotonergic effects.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: One of the abstracts explicitly mentions linezolid in the context of serotonin syndrome. Linezolid, an antibiotic, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when co-administered with other serotonergic agents.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be understood through their separate interactions with the serotonin system. Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin levels, and linezolid, by inhibiting monoamine oxidase, can also increase serotonin levels. If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine and is then prescribed linezolid, there could be an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the combined effect of both drugs on serotonin levels.

4. **Underlying Mechanisms**: The underlying mechanism involves the serotonergic system. Both drugs can lead to increased serotonin levels, albeit through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine can directly increase the release of serotonin or inhibit its reuptake, while linezolid, as an MAOI, prevents the breakdown of serotonin, leading to its accumulation.

5. **Intermediate Entities or Processes**: The key intermediate entity in this relationship is the serotonergic system, specifically the regulation of serotonin levels in the brain. The process involves the pharmacological effects of both drugs on this system, leading to a potential increase in serotonin levels and the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, while there is no direct mention of dextroamphetamine and linezolid together in the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred based on their effects on the serotonergic system. This relationship highlights the importance of careful consideration when prescribing medications that can affect serotonin levels to prevent adverse outcomes like serotonin syndrome.",34.230239391326904,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

Pegaptanib as an adjunctive treatment for complicated neovascular diabetic retinopathy.

Femoral and acetabular photopenia associated with septic hip arthritis.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Baclofen**: The abstract ""Modification of d-amphetamine-induced responses by baclofen in rats"" shows that baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, can modify the effects of d-amphetamine. Specifically, baclofen blocks the locomotor stimulatory effects of d-amphetamine and affects body temperature when co-administered with d-amphetamine. This interaction suggests that baclofen can influence the pharmacological effects of dextroamphetamine.

2. **Baclofen and Linezolid**: The connection between baclofen and linezolid is found in the abstract ""Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump."" This case report mentions a patient who was being treated with baclofen administered through an intrathecal pump and developed MRSA meningitis, which was successfully treated with linezolid. Although this does not directly imply a pharmacological interaction between baclofen and linezolid, it establishes baclofen as a context in which linezolid's efficacy was demonstrated.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be hypothesized through their separate interactions with baclofen. Dextroamphetamine's effects are modified by baclofen, and baclofen's administration context (intrathecal pump) is where linezolid showed efficacy in treating an infection. This does not imply a direct pharmacological interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid but suggests that in scenarios where baclofen is used (such as for treating spasticity or, as explored, in drug addiction contexts), the use of linezolid for infections might be relevant. The relationship is indirect because it involves considering how baclofen influences dextroamphetamine's effects and how linezolid is used in a medical context that might involve baclofen administration.

In summary, while there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid described in the abstracts, an indirect relationship can be proposed through their connections with baclofen. Baclofen modifies dextroamphetamine's effects, and linezolid has been used effectively in a context involving baclofen administration. This indirect link highlights the complexity of pharmacological interactions and the importance of considering the broader therapeutic context in which drugs are used.",26.065773248672485,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

While there is no direct mention of an interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we can infer a potential indirect relationship through intermediate entities or processes.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Baclofen**: The abstract ""Modification of d-amphetamine-induced responses by baclofen in rats"" shows that baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, can modify the effects of d-amphetamine. Specifically, baclofen blocks the locomotor stimulatory effects of d-amphetamine. This interaction suggests that baclofen can influence the behavioral effects of d-amphetamine.

2. **Baclofen and Linezolid**: The abstract ""Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump"" mentions that the patient was receiving baclofen through an intrathecal pump system. Linezolid, an antibiotic, was used to treat the patient's MRSA meningitis without removing the pump. Although this abstract does not directly describe an interaction between baclofen and linezolid, it implies that baclofen and linezolid can coexist in a therapeutic context.

3. **Potential Indirect Relationship**: Considering the above points, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could exist through the intermediate entity of baclofen. If dextroamphetamine is being used to treat a condition, such as methamphetamine addiction, and baclofen is also being administered (e.g., for spasticity), the interaction between dextroamphetamine and baclofen could be relevant. In a scenario where a patient is receiving baclofen and develops an infection that requires linezolid treatment, the indirect relationship would involve the potential for linezolid to affect the patient's condition, which is being managed with baclofen and possibly dextroamphetamine.

The underlying mechanism of this indirect relationship would involve the modulation of GABAB receptors by baclofen, which in turn affects the behavioral responses to d-amphetamine. Linezolid, as an antibiotic, would not directly interact with dextroamphetamine or baclofen but could influence the patient's overall condition, potentially impacting the efficacy or required dosage of dextroamphetamine and baclofen.

In summary, while there is no direct relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, an indirect relationship could exist through the intermediate entity of baclofen, which interacts with dextroamphetamine and is used in a therapeutic context where linezolid might also be administered. This indirect relationship highlights the complexity of pharmacological interactions and the importance of considering all medications and therapies when treating patients.",28.8979172706604,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Baclofen**: The first connection can be made through baclofen. In the abstract ""Interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and GABA-ergic drugs: clinical implications,"" it's mentioned that baclofen, a GABA-ergic drug, can inhibit the locomotor stimulant effect of phencyclidine (PCP) but not that of d-amphetamine. However, in the context of treating methamphetamine addiction, as discussed in ""Pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine addiction: an update,"" dextroamphetamine is explored as a potential treatment. Baclofen is also mentioned in this context as ineffective in proof-of-concept studies for treating methamphetamine addiction.

2. **Baclofen and Linezolid**: The connection between baclofen and linezolid can be inferred from the case report ""Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump."" In this report, a patient with an intrathecal pump system for baclofen administration developed MRSA meningitis, which was successfully treated with linezolid. This shows that in a clinical setting, linezolid can be used to treat infections in patients who are on baclofen therapy, establishing an indirect link between the use of baclofen and the potential need for linezolid in cases of infection.

3. **Dextroamphetamine, Baclofen, and Neural Pathways**: Further insight into the relationship between dextroamphetamine and baclofen can be gained from ""Differential Neural Responses Underlying the Inhibition of the Startle Response by Pre-Pulses or Gaps in Mice."" This study shows that d-amphetamine affects neural pathways related to the startle response, which can be modulated by various pharmacological agents, including those acting on GABA receptors like baclofen. Although baclofen did not rescue the effects of d-amphetamine in this specific study, it highlights the complex interplay between different neurotransmitter systems in the brain.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be described as follows: Dextroamphetamine is being explored as a treatment for methamphetamine addiction, and its effects are studied in the context of various neurotransmitter systems. Baclofen, a GABA-ergic drug, is used in certain neurological conditions and has been studied for its interactions with other substances, including its lack of effect on d-amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation. Linezolid, an antibiotic, is used to treat infections such as MRSA meningitis, which can occur in patients receiving baclofen through an intrathecal pump. Therefore, while dextroamphetamine and linezolid do not have a direct pharmacological interaction, they can be indirectly linked through the clinical contexts in which they are used, particularly in relation to baclofen therapy and the management of infections in patients with neurological conditions.",33.323835134506226,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Femoral and acetabular photopenia associated with septic hip arthritis.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C1530270'): ['16987558', '30042418', '16769855', '1999059', '8154526']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '30042418', 'added': '13431320'}",3,"('C1337027', 'C1530270')",30042418,13431320

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells.

It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry.

Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

Femoral and acetabular photopenia associated with septic hip arthritis.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.

Although the provided abstracts do not directly link dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we can propose a hypothetical connection through the concepts of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the potential for drug interactions affecting kidney function or immune response.

1. **Stress and HPA Axis Activation**: The abstract on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity relates to the level of central arousal, indicating that stress (such as sleep deprivation) can activate the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol release. Dextroamphetamine, a stimulant, could potentially induce stress or increase central arousal, thereby activating the HPA axis.

2. **Immune System Modulation**: Activation of the HPA axis and the subsequent release of cortisol can modulate the immune system. Cortisol is known to suppress the immune system, which could potentially affect the body's response to infections or the efficacy of antibiotics, including linezolid.

3. **Kidney Function and Drug Interactions**: The case report on linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis highlights the potential nephrotoxicity of linezolid, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues or those on other medications that could interact with linezolid. Dextroamphetamine might not directly interact with linezolid, but if it affects blood pressure or heart rate significantly, it could potentially influence kidney function, especially in vulnerable individuals.

4. **Indirect Relationship Hypothesis**: An indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could exist through the modulation of the immune system and kidney function. If dextroamphetamine use leads to increased stress and activation of the HPA axis, this could result in immune system suppression. Simultaneously, if an individual is taking linezolid for an infection, the suppressed immune state might affect the drug's efficacy or increase the risk of side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, especially if kidney function is already compromised or if other medications are being used that could exacerbate these effects.

In conclusion, while the abstracts do not provide a direct link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, an indirect relationship could be hypothesized through the effects of dextroamphetamine on stress levels, immune system modulation, and potential impacts on kidney function, all of which could influence the efficacy and safety profile of linezolid. This relationship is highly speculative and would require specific research to confirm any potential interactions or effects.",26.065773248672485,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

Based on the provided abstracts, a possible indirect linkage can be proposed through the following narrative:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Stress Response**: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant that can affect the central nervous system, potentially altering the body's stress response. The abstract on ""Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is related to the level of central arousal"" suggests that central arousal, which can be influenced by stimulants like dextroamphetamine, is associated with the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress, regulating the release of cortisol and other hormones.

2. **Stress Response and Immune System**: The activation of the HPA axis and the subsequent release of cortisol can have immunomodulatory effects. Chronic or excessive stress, potentially induced by stimulant use, can suppress or alter the immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections.

3. **Infections and Linezolid Use**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Individuals with compromised immune systems, possibly due to chronic stress or other factors, may be more prone to such infections, thereby increasing the likelihood of linezolid prescription.

4. **Linezolid Side Effects and Organ Dysfunction**: The abstract on ""Linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis in a kidney-transplant patient"" highlights a rare but serious side effect of linezolid—renal toxicity. This suggests that linezolid, while effective against certain infections, can have significant adverse effects on organ function, particularly in vulnerable populations like kidney transplant patients.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be hypothesized as follows: The use of dextroamphetamine may contribute to an altered stress response, potentially weakening the immune system. A compromised immune system increases the risk of infections that may require treatment with antibiotics like linezolid. The use of linezolid, in turn, carries risks of side effects such as renal toxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing organ dysfunction. Thus, while dextroamphetamine and linezolid are not directly related in terms of their pharmacological mechanisms, their use can be indirectly linked through the broader context of stress, immune response, infection risk, and the consequent need for antibiotic treatment.",28.8979172706604,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

Based on the provided abstracts, a possible indirect linkage can be proposed through the concept of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the immune system.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Stress**: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant that can increase alertness and energy. Its use, especially in a recreational context as mentioned in one of the abstracts, can lead to increased stress levels. Stress activates the HPA axis, leading to the release of cortisol and other hormones.

2. **HPA Axis and Immune System**: The activation of the HPA axis and the subsequent release of cortisol have a suppressive effect on the immune system. Chronic or acute stress can impair immune function, making an individual more susceptible to infections.

3. **Infections and Linezolid**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. Individuals with compromised immune systems due to stress or other factors may be more prone to such infections, necessitating the use of antibiotics like linezolid.

4. **Potential for Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be mediated through the stress response and its impact on the immune system. The use of dextroamphetamine could lead to increased stress, which in turn could weaken the immune system, making a person more susceptible to infections that might require treatment with linezolid.

This narrative connects the elements of stress, immune suppression, and susceptibility to infections as a potential pathway through which dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be indirectly related. However, it's crucial to note that this relationship is speculative and based on the general principles of pharmacology, immunology, and the effects of stimulants on the body, rather than direct evidence from the provided abstracts.",33.323835134506226,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry.

At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C1530270'): ['16987558', '30042418', '16769855', '1999059', '8154526']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '30042418', 'added': '13431320'}",3,"('C1337027', 'C1530270')",30042418,13431320

The provided abstracts do not directly link dextroamphetamine and linezolid, but we can attempt to establish a connection through the concepts and mechanisms discussed.

1. **Stress and the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis**: The abstract on the HPA axis activity and its relation to the level of central arousal provides a starting point. Dextroamphetamine, a stimulant, can increase central arousal and potentially affect the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol levels. Elevated cortisol levels can have various systemic effects, including impacts on the immune system and potentially on drug metabolism or efficacy.

2. **Immune System Modulation and Infections**: The connection to the immune system is crucial because linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. If dextroamphetamine use leads to increased stress and cortisol levels, it could theoretically modulate the immune response, making an individual more susceptible to infections that linezolid would be used to treat.

3. **Kidney Function and Drug Clearance**: The abstract on linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis highlights the potential nephrotoxicity of linezolid. Dextroamphetamine, through its effects on blood pressure and potentially on kidney function (especially with chronic use or in susceptible individuals), could theoretically influence the clearance of linezolid, affecting its plasma levels and increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity.

4. **Central Nervous System Effects and Drug Interactions**: Both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can have central nervous system (CNS) effects. Dextroamphetamine is a CNS stimulant, and linezolid has been associated with CNS effects such as serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with other serotonergic agents. While there's no direct interaction mentioned, the potential for additive or synergistic CNS effects if these drugs are used concurrently could be a concern.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be hypothesized through several mechanisms:
- **Increased susceptibility to infections** due to immune system modulation by dextroamphetamine, potentially leading to a greater need for antibiotics like linezolid.
- **Effects on kidney function** that could influence linezolid clearance and increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.
- **Potential for CNS interactions** if these drugs are used together, given their individual effects on the central nervous system.

These connections are speculative and based on the general principles of pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology discussed in the abstracts. Direct evidence of an interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid would require specific studies investigating their combined use.",34.230239391326904,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and ADHD**: Dextroamphetamine is used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patients with ADHD often have comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance abuse.
2. **Comorbidities and infections**: Individuals with ADHD and comorbidities may be more susceptible to infections, which can lead to the use of antibiotics like linezolid.
3. **Linezolid and Gram-positive bacteria**: Linezolid is an antibiotic effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is often used in critically ill patients or those with impaired renal function.
4. **Renal function and medication interactions**: Patients with impaired renal function may require dose adjustments for certain medications, including linezolid. Dextroamphetamine, although not directly interacting with linezolid, may be used in patients with ADHD who also have renal impairment or are taking other medications that interact with linezolid.
5. **Psychiatric comorbidities and medication use**: The presence of psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety or mood disorders, may influence the choice of medications, including antibiotics like linezolid. For example, patients with anxiety disorders may be more likely to receive linezolid due to its anxiolytic effects or may be more susceptible to linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.
6. **Thrombocytopenia and platelet count monitoring**: Linezolid can cause thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Monitoring platelet counts is essential in these patients. Dextroamphetamine, although not directly related to thrombocytopenia, may be used in patients who require platelet count monitoring due to other medications or medical conditions.
7. **Vancomycin and linezolid**: Vancomycin is another antibiotic that can be used to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections. However, vancomycin-induced DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome is a rare but serious side effect. Linezolid may be considered as an alternative to vancomycin in patients who develop DRESS syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid may exist through the following pathways:

* Dextroamphetamine is used to treat ADHD, which often co-occurs with other psychiatric comorbidities.
* These comorbidities may increase the risk of infections, leading to the use of antibiotics like linezolid.
* Linezolid is used to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections, particularly in critically ill patients or those with impaired renal function.
* Patients with impaired renal function may require dose adjustments for linezolid, and dextroamphetamine may be used in patients with ADHD who also have renal impairment or are taking other medications that interact with linezolid.
* The presence of psychiatric comorbidities may influence the choice of medications, including antibiotics like linezolid, and may increase the risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.

While there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, the complex relationships between ADHD, psychiatric comorbidities, infections, and medication use create an indirect link between these two medications.",26.065773248672485,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and ADHD**: Dextroamphetamine is used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patients with ADHD often have comorbidities such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance abuse.
2. **Anxiety disorders and linezolid**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including those that can cause anxiety disorders or exacerbate existing anxiety conditions. In some cases, linezolid may be prescribed to patients with anxiety disorders who have developed infections.
3. **Vancomycin and linezolid**: Vancomycin is another antibiotic that can be used to treat similar infections. However, vancomycin has been associated with a higher risk of nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Linezolid is sometimes used as an alternative to vancomycin in these cases.
4. **Dextroamphetamine and vancomycin**: Although there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and vancomycin, patients with ADHD who are taking dextroamphetamine may be more likely to experience anxiety or other comorbidities that require treatment with antibiotics like vancomycin.
5. **Linezolid and thrombocytopenia**: Linezolid has been associated with thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. This condition can increase the risk of bleeding and may require careful monitoring and dose adjustment.
6. **Dextroamphetamine and platelet count**: Some studies suggest that psychostimulants like dextroamphetamine may affect platelet count or increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, although this is not a well-established relationship.

The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be summarized as follows:

* Dextroamphetamine is used to treat ADHD, which often co-occurs with anxiety disorders or other conditions that may require antibiotic treatment.
* Linezolid is an antibiotic that may be prescribed to patients with anxiety disorders or other conditions that are comorbid with ADHD.
* Vancomycin, an alternative antibiotic, has a higher risk of nephrotoxicity, which may lead to the use of linezolid as a substitute.
* Linezolid has been associated with thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.
* Dextroamphetamine may potentially affect platelet count or increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, although this relationship is not well established.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on the comorbidities associated with ADHD, the use of antibiotics like vancomycin and linezolid, and the potential risks of thrombocytopenia associated with linezolid.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine.

Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and ADHD**: Dextroamphetamine is commonly used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patients with ADHD often have comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance abuse.
2. **Comorbidities and antibiotic use**: Individuals with ADHD and comorbidities may be more likely to require antibiotic treatment for various infections. Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat severe infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
3. **Linezolid and renal function**: Linezolid can cause thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Renal function is crucial in eliminating linezolid, and impaired renal function can lead to increased plasma concentrations of the drug.
4. **Dextroamphetamine and renal function**: Although not directly related, dextroamphetamine may indirectly affect renal function in patients with ADHD and comorbidities. For example, patients with ADHD and substance abuse may be more likely to experience renal impairment due to drug use or other factors.
5. **Intermediate entities: psychiatric disorders and substance abuse**: Psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders, can increase the risk of substance abuse, which may lead to renal impairment. Dextroamphetamine, used to treat ADHD, may be prescribed to patients with these comorbidities, potentially increasing the risk of substance abuse and subsequent renal impairment.
6. **Linezolid and dextroamphetamine interaction**: Although there is no direct interaction between linezolid and dextroamphetamine, the indirect relationship lies in the potential for patients with ADHD and comorbidities to require linezolid treatment and experience renal impairment, which can increase the risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid may exist through the following pathway:

ADHD (treated with dextroamphetamine) → Comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, mood disorders, substance abuse) → Increased risk of antibiotic use (e.g., linezolid) → Renal impairment (due to various factors, including substance abuse) → Increased risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Pegaptanib as an adjunctive treatment for complicated neovascular diabetic retinopathy.

Femoral and acetabular photopenia associated with septic hip arthritis.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.","{('C0076080', 'C1337027'): ['31575897', '28122345', '7526324', '27867508', '10155955'], ('C1337027', 'C1530270'): ['16987558', '30042418', '16769855', '1999059', '8154526']}","{'edge': ('C1337027', 'C1530270'), 'dropped': '30042418', 'added': '13431320'}",3,"('C1337027', 'C1530270')",30042418,13431320

The risk of serotonin syndrome (SS), especially when linezolid is used concomitantly with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine, remains widely unstudied and may limit the options for antimicrobial therapy in these patient populations. We reviewed all adult encounters on linezolid with concomitant methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine from April 2016 to June 2022. The primary outcomes included characterizing prescribing preferences and prevalence of confirmed and possible serotonin syndrome using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, cyproheptadine administration, and electronic medical record chart review using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Overall, 194 encounters were evaluated. 16.5%, 17.8%, and 7.1% were on high dose methadone, buprenorphine, and dextroamphetamine, respectively. Mean duration of overlap with linezolid was 4.6, 3.3, and 7 days respectively. One confirmed and two possible cases of serotonin syndrome were identified. Linezolid may be considered in patients who are concomitantly on methadone, buprenorphine, and/or dextroamphetamine. In our analysis of 194 encounters, one definitive case and two possible cases of SS were identified. Additional real-world studies are necessary to identify if exposure and/or duration may be correlated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

While there is no direct mention of a relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid in the provided abstracts, we can infer a potential indirect relationship through the following steps:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's Primary Use**: Dextroamphetamine is primarily used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It's known for its efficacy in improving focus and reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity in patients with ADHD.

2. **Comorbidities with ADHD**: Individuals with ADHD often have comorbid psychiatric conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. The treatment of these comorbid conditions may involve the use of various medications, including antidepressants and anxiolytics.

3. **Linezolid's Use**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat certain bacterial infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is particularly useful in treating infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

4. **Potential Intersection**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could arise in the context of treating patients with ADHD who also have conditions that require the use of linezolid. For instance, a patient with ADHD might develop a bacterial infection that necessitates the use of linezolid. In such cases, the patient would be on both dextroamphetamine for ADHD and linezolid for the bacterial infection.

5. **Consideration of Drug Interactions**: When patients are on multiple medications, there is always a concern about potential drug interactions. Although the abstracts do not specifically mention interactions between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, it is crucial to monitor patients for any adverse effects when they are taking multiple drugs, especially if they have impaired renal function, as linezolid's clearance can be reduced in such cases, potentially leading to higher plasma concentrations and increased risk of side effects like thrombocytopenia.

6. **Psychiatric and Medical Comorbidities**: The management of psychiatric conditions, including ADHD, in patients with medical comorbidities that require antibiotics like linezolid, necessitates careful consideration of the potential impact of these medications on each other and on the patient's overall health. This includes monitoring for signs of drug-induced thrombocytopenia or other hematologic effects associated with linezolid, especially in patients with renal impairment.

In summary, while there is no direct relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid mentioned in the abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred through the treatment of comorbid conditions in patients with ADHD, the potential for drug interactions, and the need for careful management of patients on multiple medications, particularly when renal function is impaired. Clinicians should be aware of these potential interactions and monitor patients closely to minimize adverse effects.",34.230239391326904,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

Femoral and acetabular photopenia associated with septic hip arthritis.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

1. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Brain Fatty Acid Profiles**: The F3 wt Allele could influence dietary preferences or metabolism, leading to altered intake or processing of fatty acids. This, in turn, could affect brain fatty acid profiles, as seen in studies where high dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs) modified brain fatty acid profiles without directly altering amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in an Alzheimer's disease model (Abstract 1). The brain's fatty acid composition, particularly the balance between omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is crucial for brain function and has been linked to cognitive decline and AD (Abstract 3).

2. **Trans Fatty Acids and Amyloidogenic Processing**: Trans fatty acids, which can be influenced by dietary habits potentially linked to the F3 wt Allele, have been shown to enhance amyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased production of amyloid-beta peptides, a hallmark of AD (Abstract 4). This suggests a pathway where dietary factors, possibly influenced by genetic predispositions like the F3 wt Allele, could indirectly contribute to AD pathology through the modulation of brain fatty acid profiles and APP processing.

3. **Vitamin E and Tocopherol Forms**: The relationship between vitamin E intake and AD risk (Abstract 5) introduces another potential pathway. If the F3 wt Allele influences vitamin E metabolism or dietary intake, this could impact AD risk. Vitamin E, particularly in its various tocopherol forms, has been associated with a reduced incidence of AD, possibly through antioxidant effects that protect against neuronal damage.

4. **Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Pathways**: The connection between trans fatty acid consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Abstracts 6 and 7) is relevant because T2D is a known risk factor for AD. An indirect relationship could exist if the F3 wt Allele affects metabolic pathways or dietary preferences that increase T2D risk, thereby indirectly influencing AD risk.

5. **Gut-Brain Axis and Fatty Acid Modulation**: The modulation of the gut-brain axis by different types of fatty acids (Abstract 8) suggests another potential mechanism. The F3 wt Allele could influence fatty acid metabolism or preference, affecting the gut-brain axis and, by extension, cognitive health and AD risk.

6. **Detection and Dietary Assessment of Trans Fatty Acids**: The development of methods for detecting trans fatty acids in food samples (Abstract 9) underscores the importance of accurately assessing dietary intake of these fatty acids. If the F3 wt Allele is associated with preferences for or metabolic handling of dietary fats, accurate detection methods could help elucidate indirect relationships between the allele, dietary fatty acid intake, and AD risk.

In summary, while the abstracts do not directly link the F3 wt Allele to Alzheimer's Disease, they suggest several indirect pathways through which such a relationship could exist. These pathways involve dietary fatty acids, brain fatty acid profiles, amyloidogenic processing, vitamin E metabolism, type 2 diabetes risk, and modulation of the gut-brain axis. Further research would be necessary to establish whether the F3 wt Allele indeed influences these factors and, by extension, AD risk.",41.17671751976013,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Alcohol expectancies longitudinally predict drinking and the alcohol myopia effects of relief, self-inflation, and excess. Alcohol myopia theory posits that alcohol consumption attenuates information processing capacity, and that expectancy beliefs together with intake level are responsible for experiences in myopic effects (relief, self-inflation, and excess). Adults (N=413) averaging 36.39 (SD=13.02) years of age completed the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire at baseline, followed by alcohol use measures (frequency and quantity) and the Alcohol Myopia Scale one month later. Three structural equation models based on differing construct manifestations of alcohol expectancies served to longitudinally forecast alcohol use and myopia. In Model 1, overall expectancy predicted greater alcohol use and higher levels of all three myopic effects. In Model 2, specifying separate positive and negative expectancy factors, positive but not negative expectancy predicted greater use. Furthermore, positive expectancy and use explained higher myopic relief and higher self-inflation, whereas positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and use explained higher myopic excess. In Model 3, the seven specific expectancy subscales (sociability, tension reduction, liquid courage, sexuality, cognitive and behavioral impairment, risk and aggression, and self-perception) were simultaneously specified as predictors. Tension reduction expectancy, sexuality expectancy, and use contributed to higher myopic relief; sexuality expectancy and use explained higher myopic self-inflation; and risk and aggression expectancy and use accounted for higher myopic excess. Across all three predictive models, the total variance explained ranged from 12 to 19% for alcohol use, 50 to 51% for relief, 29 to 34% for self-inflation, and 32 to 35% for excess. Findings support that the type of alcohol myopia experienced is a concurrent function of self-fulfilling alcohol prophecies and drinking levels. The interpreted measurement manifestation of expectancy yielded different prevention implications.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

1. **Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs)**: High dietary intake of TFAs has been associated with an increased risk of developing AD. TFAs can alter brain fatty acid profiles, decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids. This shift in fatty acid composition may contribute to the development of AD.
2. **Influence of TFAs on amyloidogenic processing of APP**: TFAs have been shown to enhance the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to an increased production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD.
3. **Association between TFAs and body fat distribution**: TFAs have been linked to fat deposition in the trunk area, which may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, a known risk factor for AD.
4. **Impact of TFAs on cognitive decline**: Some studies suggest that TFAs may be associated with cognitive decline, which is a precursor to AD.
5. **Role of vitamin E and other nutrients**: Vitamin E, particularly alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol, has been shown to have a protective effect against AD. A diet rich in vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, and other nutrients may help mitigate the risk of AD.
6. **F3 wt Allele and lipid metabolism**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, the F3 wt Allele may be involved in lipid metabolism, which could influence the development of AD. For example, the F3 gene is involved in the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and alterations in lipid metabolism may contribute to the development of AD.

The potential indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD could be mediated by the following intermediate entities or processes:

* Dietary consumption of TFAs
* Alterations in brain fatty acid profiles
* Enhanced amyloidogenic processing of APP
* Body fat distribution and metabolic disorders
* Cognitive decline
* Lipid metabolism and coagulation pathways

In summary, while there is no direct evidence linking the F3 wt Allele to AD, the provided abstracts suggest that an indirect relationship may exist through the influence of dietary TFAs, alterations in lipid metabolism, and the subsequent development of metabolic disorders and cognitive decline.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

1. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Brain Fatty Acid Profile**: The F3 wt Allele could influence dietary preferences or metabolism, leading to an altered intake of fatty acids, such as trans fatty acids (TFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). This, in turn, could modify the brain fatty acid profile, as seen in the study where high TFA consumption decreased brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. A decreased DHA level has been linked to cognitive decline and AD.

2. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. TFAs, which are known to induce inflammation and oxidative stress, could exacerbate this condition, contributing to the development of AD. The molecular mechanisms underlying the toxic actions of TFAs, including cell death and inflammation, could play a crucial role in this process.

3. **Amyloid-Beta Processing and Aggregation**: The F3 wt Allele could influence the processing and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD. TFAs have been shown to enhance the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased production of Aβ peptides. This could contribute to the formation of senile plaques, a characteristic neuropathological feature of AD.

4. **Vitamin E and Tocopherol Forms**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism or absorption of vitamin E and its various forms, such as alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol. These tocopherol forms have been shown to have protective effects against AD, and their altered levels could influence the risk of developing the disease.

5. **Body Fat Distribution and Metabolic Factors**: The F3 wt Allele could influence body fat distribution, particularly in the trunk area, which has been linked to an increased risk of AD. TFAs have been shown to contribute to fat deposition in the trunk area, and this could be an intermediate factor in the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.

6. **Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome, which are known risk factors for AD. TFAs have been shown to have both positive and negative associations with T2D risk, depending on their conformation and source (industrial or ruminant).

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve a complex interplay of dietary fatty acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, amyloid-beta processing, vitamin E metabolism, body fat distribution, and metabolic factors.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

1. **Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs)**: TFAs have been associated with an increased risk of AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence dietary preferences or metabolism, leading to increased TFA consumption.
2. **Brain fatty acid profile modification**: High TFA intake can modify the brain fatty acid profile, decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids. This alteration might contribute to AD development.
3. **Amyloidogenic processing of APP**: TFAs can enhance the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD.
4. **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: TFAs can induce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known to contribute to AD pathogenesis.
5. **Vitamin E and tocopherol forms**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism or absorption of vitamin E and tocopherol forms, which have been shown to have a protective association with AD.
6. **Body fat distribution**: TFAs have been linked to increased trunk fat percentage, which might be associated with an increased risk of AD.
7. **Industrial and ruminant TFAs**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the metabolism or absorption of different types of TFAs, which have varying effects on AD risk.

The potential indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD can be illustrated as follows:

F3 wt Allele → Dietary preferences/metabolism → TFA consumption → Brain fatty acid profile modification → Amyloidogenic processing of APP → Inflammation and oxidative stress → AD development

Alternatively, the relationship could be:

F3 wt Allele → Vitamin E/tocopherol metabolism → AD protection → AD development

Or:

F3 wt Allele → Body fat distribution → AD risk

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

An Investigation of Calibration Phantoms for CT Scanners with Tube Voltage Modulation. The effects of calibration phantoms on the correction results of the empirical artifacts correction method (ECCU) for the case of tube modulation were investigated. To improve the validity of the ECCU method, the effect of the geometry parameter of a typical single-material calibration phantom (water calibration phantom) on the ECCU algorithm was investigated. Dual-material calibration phantoms (such as water-bone calibration phantom), geometry arrangement, and the area-ratio of dual-material calibration phantoms were also studied. Preliminary results implied that, to assure the effectiveness of the ECCU algorithm, the polychromatic projections of calibration phantoms must cover the polychromatic projection data of the scanning object. However, the projection range of a water calibration phantom is limited by the scan field of view (SFOV), thus leading to methodological limitations. A dual-material phantom of a proper size and material can overcome the limitations of a single-material phantom and achieve good correction effects.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress.

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the metabolism of fatty acids, including monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. An imbalance in these fatty acids has been linked to cognitive decline and AD (Abstract 1).
2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD is associated with cognitive decline and AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD, which in turn affects brain perfusion, inflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately leading to AD (Abstract 1).
3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that play a crucial role in neuronal function. Low plasmalogen levels have been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence plasmalogen metabolism, leading to decreased plasmalogen levels and increased AD risk (Abstract 2).
4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism of dietary fatty acids, including saturated (SFAs), MUFAs, and PUFAs. An imbalance in these fatty acids has been linked to cognitive decline and AD (Abstracts 3-6).
5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known risk factors for AD. This could be mediated through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, NAFLD, or other mechanisms (Abstracts 1, 7, and 8).
6. **Gut-Brain Axis**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the gut-brain axis, which is involved in the regulation of metabolic responses, including those related to fatty acid metabolism. Alterations in the gut-brain axis have been linked to AD (Abstract 9).
7. **Trans-Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism of trans-fatty acids, which have been linked to increased AD risk. This could be mediated through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism or other mechanisms (Abstracts 10-12).

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, NAFLD, plasmalogen levels, dietary fatty acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, the gut-brain axis, and trans-fatty acids.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Alcohol expectancies longitudinally predict drinking and the alcohol myopia effects of relief, self-inflation, and excess. Alcohol myopia theory posits that alcohol consumption attenuates information processing capacity, and that expectancy beliefs together with intake level are responsible for experiences in myopic effects (relief, self-inflation, and excess). Adults (N=413) averaging 36.39 (SD=13.02) years of age completed the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire at baseline, followed by alcohol use measures (frequency and quantity) and the Alcohol Myopia Scale one month later. Three structural equation models based on differing construct manifestations of alcohol expectancies served to longitudinally forecast alcohol use and myopia. In Model 1, overall expectancy predicted greater alcohol use and higher levels of all three myopic effects. In Model 2, specifying separate positive and negative expectancy factors, positive but not negative expectancy predicted greater use. Furthermore, positive expectancy and use explained higher myopic relief and higher self-inflation, whereas positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and use explained higher myopic excess. In Model 3, the seven specific expectancy subscales (sociability, tension reduction, liquid courage, sexuality, cognitive and behavioral impairment, risk and aggression, and self-perception) were simultaneously specified as predictors. Tension reduction expectancy, sexuality expectancy, and use contributed to higher myopic relief; sexuality expectancy and use explained higher myopic self-inflation; and risk and aggression expectancy and use accounted for higher myopic excess. Across all three predictive models, the total variance explained ranged from 12 to 19% for alcohol use, 50 to 51% for relief, 29 to 34% for self-inflation, and 32 to 35% for excess. Findings support that the type of alcohol myopia experienced is a concurrent function of self-fulfilling alcohol prophecies and drinking levels. The interpreted measurement manifestation of expectancy yielded different prevention implications.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the metabolism of fatty acids, including monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. These fatty acids play a crucial role in maintaining brain health and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.

2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD has been linked to cognitive decline and AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to brain hypoperfusion, inflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that are essential for normal neuron function. Low levels of plasmalogens have been associated with AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence plasmalogen levels by regulating the metabolism of fatty acids, which are necessary for plasmalogen synthesis.

4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect an individual's response to dietary fatty acids, including saturated (SFAs), MUFAs, and PUFAs. A diet high in SFAs and low in MUFAs and PUFAs has been linked to an increased risk of AD. The F3 wt Allele might modulate the effects of dietary fatty acids on AD risk by influencing fatty acid metabolism and plasmalogen levels.

5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are key features of AD. Altered fatty acid metabolism and low plasmalogen levels might lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

6. **Gut-Brain Axis**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the gut-brain axis, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health. An imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, has been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to dysbiosis by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to changes in the gut-brain axis and increase the risk of AD.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, which in turn influences NAFLD, plasmalogen levels, dietary fatty acid responses, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the gut-brain axis. These intermediate entities and processes might contribute to the development and progression of AD in individuals with the F3 wt Allele. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.",28.509257316589355,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the metabolism of fatty acids, including monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. These fatty acids play a crucial role in maintaining brain health and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.

2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD has been linked to cognitive decline and AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to brain hypoperfusion, inflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that are essential for normal neuron function. Low levels of plasmalogens have been associated with AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence plasmalogen levels by regulating the metabolism of fatty acids, which are necessary for plasmalogen synthesis.

4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect an individual's response to dietary fatty acids, including saturated (SFAs), MUFAs, and PUFAs. A diet high in SFAs and low in MUFAs and PUFAs has been linked to an increased risk of AD. The F3 wt Allele might modulate the effects of dietary fatty acids on AD risk by influencing fatty acid metabolism and plasmalogen levels.

5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are key features of AD. Altered fatty acid metabolism and low plasmalogen levels might lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

6. **Gut-Brain Axis**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the gut-brain axis, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health. An imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, has been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to dysbiosis by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to changes in the gut-brain axis and increase the risk of AD.

In summary, the F3 wt Allele might be indirectly related to AD through its effects on fatty acid metabolism, NAFLD, plasmalogen levels, dietary fatty acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the gut-brain axis. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.",34.48418140411377,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults.

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the balance of different fatty acids in the body, including monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs).
2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD is associated with altered fatty acid metabolism, which can lead to brain hypoperfusion and cognitive decline. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD, which in turn increases the risk of AD.
3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that play a crucial role in neuronal function. Low plasmalogen levels have been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might affect plasmalogen synthesis or degradation, leading to decreased plasmalogen levels and increased AD risk.
4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might influence an individual's response to dietary fatty acids, such as MUFAs, PUFAs, and SFAs. A diet high in SFAs and low in MUFAs and PUFAs has been linked to an increased risk of AD.
5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
6. **Blood-Brain Barrier Function**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the function of the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxic substances to enter the brain and contributing to AD pathology.
7. **Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Interaction**: The F3 wt Allele might interact with the APOE gene, which is a known risk factor for AD. This interaction could influence the risk of AD in individuals carrying the F3 wt Allele.

The possible indirect linkage between the F3 wt Allele and AD can be summarized as follows:

F3 wt Allele → Altered Fatty Acid Metabolism → NAFLD → Brain Hypoperfusion → Cognitive Decline → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Decreased Plasmalogen Levels → Neuronal Dysfunction → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Increased Inflammation and Oxidative Stress → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Impaired Blood-Brain Barrier Function → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Interaction with APOE → Increased AD Risk

These hypothetical pathways highlight the potential indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD, involving various intermediate entities and mechanisms.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

An Investigation of Calibration Phantoms for CT Scanners with Tube Voltage Modulation. The effects of calibration phantoms on the correction results of the empirical artifacts correction method (ECCU) for the case of tube modulation were investigated. To improve the validity of the ECCU method, the effect of the geometry parameter of a typical single-material calibration phantom (water calibration phantom) on the ECCU algorithm was investigated. Dual-material calibration phantoms (such as water-bone calibration phantom), geometry arrangement, and the area-ratio of dual-material calibration phantoms were also studied. Preliminary results implied that, to assure the effectiveness of the ECCU algorithm, the polychromatic projections of calibration phantoms must cover the polychromatic projection data of the scanning object. However, the projection range of a water calibration phantom is limited by the scan field of view (SFOV), thus leading to methodological limitations. A dual-material phantom of a proper size and material can overcome the limitations of a single-material phantom and achieve good correction effects.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

1. **Fatty acid composition and brain health**: The first abstract suggests that changes in fatty acid composition, particularly an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids, are associated with Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and variations in this gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence fatty acid composition in the brain, potentially contributing to AD risk.
2. **Dietary fatty acids and cognitive decline**: The second abstract highlights the importance of dietary fatty acids in maintaining cognitive function and potentially preventing AD. A diet rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as those found in olive oil, may have a protective effect against cognitive decline. The F3 wt Allele might interact with dietary fatty acid intake to influence AD risk, with a potential synergistic effect between the allele and a healthy diet.
3. **Gut-brain axis and fatty acid metabolism**: The fifth abstract demonstrates that high-fat diets with different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis in obese mice. The F3 gene is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and alterations in this gene might affect the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to AD risk. The gut-brain axis is a key regulator of brain health, and changes in fatty acid metabolism might influence this axis, leading to an increased risk of AD.
4. **Olive oil and Mediterranean diet**: The fourth abstract highlights the potential benefits of olive oil and the Mediterranean diet in reducing AD risk. The F3 wt Allele might interact with the Mediterranean diet to influence AD risk, with a potential protective effect of the diet in individuals with the F3 wt Allele.
5. **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: Several abstracts mention the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis. The F3 gene is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and alterations in this gene might influence inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially contributing to AD risk.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the following pathways:

F3 wt Allele → altered fatty acid metabolism → changes in brain fatty acid composition → increased risk of AD
F3 wt Allele → interaction with dietary fatty acid intake → modulation of cognitive decline and AD risk
F3 wt Allele → altered gut-brain axis function → changes in brain health and increased AD risk
F3 wt Allele → interaction with Mediterranean diet → modulation of AD risk
F3 wt Allele → altered inflammation and oxidative stress → increased AD risk

These pathways are speculative and require further research to confirm the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease.",41.17671751976013,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Alcohol expectancies longitudinally predict drinking and the alcohol myopia effects of relief, self-inflation, and excess. Alcohol myopia theory posits that alcohol consumption attenuates information processing capacity, and that expectancy beliefs together with intake level are responsible for experiences in myopic effects (relief, self-inflation, and excess). Adults (N=413) averaging 36.39 (SD=13.02) years of age completed the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire at baseline, followed by alcohol use measures (frequency and quantity) and the Alcohol Myopia Scale one month later. Three structural equation models based on differing construct manifestations of alcohol expectancies served to longitudinally forecast alcohol use and myopia. In Model 1, overall expectancy predicted greater alcohol use and higher levels of all three myopic effects. In Model 2, specifying separate positive and negative expectancy factors, positive but not negative expectancy predicted greater use. Furthermore, positive expectancy and use explained higher myopic relief and higher self-inflation, whereas positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and use explained higher myopic excess. In Model 3, the seven specific expectancy subscales (sociability, tension reduction, liquid courage, sexuality, cognitive and behavioral impairment, risk and aggression, and self-perception) were simultaneously specified as predictors. Tension reduction expectancy, sexuality expectancy, and use contributed to higher myopic relief; sexuality expectancy and use explained higher myopic self-inflation; and risk and aggression expectancy and use accounted for higher myopic excess. Across all three predictive models, the total variance explained ranged from 12 to 19% for alcohol use, 50 to 51% for relief, 29 to 34% for self-inflation, and 32 to 35% for excess. Findings support that the type of alcohol myopia experienced is a concurrent function of self-fulfilling alcohol prophecies and drinking levels. The interpreted measurement manifestation of expectancy yielded different prevention implications.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults.

1. **Fatty Acid Composition and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract highlights changes in the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in Alzheimer's disease, particularly an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. This alteration could affect cellular function and contribute to neural deficiencies.

2. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline**: The second abstract discusses the epidemiological evidence suggesting that dietary patterns rich in unsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish, olive oil) may have a protective effect against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. This implies that the type of dietary fatty acids could influence the risk of developing AD.

3. **Olive Oil, Mediterranean Diet, and Health**: The third abstract reinforces the idea that the Mediterranean Diet, characterized by high consumption of olive oil (rich in monounsaturated fatty acids), is associated with a reduced risk of several diseases, including Alzheimer's. This diet's potential protective effects on cognitive decline could be mediated through its fatty acid composition.

4. **Gut-Brain Axis and Fatty Acids**: The abstract on high-fat diets and the gut-brain axis in obese mice suggests that different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis, potentially influencing metabolic responses and cognitive functions. This indicates a complex interaction between dietary fatty acids, gut health, and brain function.

Given these points, a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be hypothesized as follows:

- **F3 wt Allele Influence on Fatty Acid Metabolism**: If the F3 wt Allele influences fatty acid metabolism or the composition of fatty acids in the body (possibly through effects on enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis or degradation), this could, in turn, affect the types of fatty acids available for incorporation into brain phospholipids.

- **Impact on Brain Phospholipid Composition**: Changes in the availability of certain fatty acids for brain phospholipid synthesis could lead to alterations in the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids, similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease (increased saturated, decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids).

- **Influence on Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease Risk**: The altered brain phospholipid composition could then contribute to an increased risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, potentially through mechanisms involving changes in membrane fluidity, neuronal transmission, and susceptibility to oxidative stress or inflammation.

- **Dietary Interventions as Modulators**: The relationship between dietary fatty acid intake and Alzheimer's disease risk suggests that dietary patterns (e.g., high intake of unsaturated fatty acids) could modulate this risk. If the F3 wt Allele affects how dietary fatty acids are metabolized or utilized, this could further influence an individual's risk profile for Alzheimer's disease based on their diet.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could involve the allele's influence on fatty acid metabolism, which in turn affects brain phospholipid composition and, consequently, the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Dietary patterns rich in certain types of fatty acids could play a crucial role in modulating this risk. However, this hypothesis requires further research to understand the specific mechanisms and interactions involved.",28.509257316589355,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

Although none of the abstracts directly mention the F3 wt Allele, we can infer a potential indirect relationship through the discussion of fatty acid composition, dietary influences on cognitive decline, and the role of fatty acids in neural function and disease.

1. **Fatty Acid Composition and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract discusses changes in the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in Alzheimer's disease, noting an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. This alteration in fatty acid composition could influence cellular function and contribute to neural deficiencies associated with AD.

2. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline**: The second abstract highlights the epidemiological evidence suggesting that dietary patterns rich in unsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish, olive oil) may have a protective effect against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, high intake of saturated fatty acids is associated with negative effects on cognitive health.

3. **Olive Oil, Mediterranean Diet, and Health**: The third abstract emphasizes the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, which is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) from olive oil. This dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and possibly a lower risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.

4. **Fatty Acids, Gut-Brain Axis, and Metabolic Responses**: The abstract on high-fat diets and the gut-brain axis in obese mice suggests that different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis, leading to distinct alterations in metabolic responses. This could imply that the type of dietary fatty acids influences not only metabolic health but also brain function and potentially the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Given these points, a hypothetical indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be proposed as follows:

- **Genetic Influence on Fatty Acid Metabolism**: Assume that the F3 wt Allele influences fatty acid metabolism or the preference for certain types of dietary fatty acids. This could be through encoding a protein involved in lipid metabolism or by affecting the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis or degradation.

- **Dietary Fatty Acid Intake and Alzheimer's Risk**: The type and amount of dietary fatty acids consumed could influence an individual's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, as suggested by the epidemiological evidence on dietary patterns and cognitive health.

- **Mechanistic Link**: The mechanism linking dietary fatty acids to Alzheimer's disease could involve the modification of brain phospholipid composition, inflammation, oxidative stress, or the maintenance of the structural integrity of neuronal membranes. These factors could, in turn, affect the accumulation of amyloid-beta, tau phosphorylation, or other pathological features of Alzheimer's disease.

- **Indirect Relationship**: If the F3 wt Allele affects an individual's fatty acid metabolism or dietary preferences, and if these factors influence the risk of Alzheimer's disease, then there could be an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease. This relationship would be mediated by the intermediate effects on fatty acid metabolism and dietary intake.

This narrative connects the abstracts by highlighting the importance of fatty acid composition in health and disease, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease. It proposes a potential pathway through which genetic factors influencing fatty acid metabolism could indirectly affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, it's crucial to note that this is a speculative connection based on the information provided and would require direct research evidence to confirm the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease.",34.48418140411377,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

The connection can be hypothesized through the discussion of fatty acid compositions, dietary influences on cognitive decline, and the role of specific fatty acids in neurological health.

1. **Fatty Acid Composition and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract discusses changes in brain phospholipid fatty acid composition in Alzheimer's disease, noting an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. This alteration could affect neuronal membrane fluidity and, consequently, neuronal function.

2. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline**: The second abstract highlights epidemiological evidence suggesting that dietary patterns rich in unsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish and olive oil) may have a protective effect against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, high intake of saturated fatty acids is associated with negative effects on cognitive health.

3. **Olive Oil, Monounsaturated Fatty Acids, and Health**: The third abstract emphasizes the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, which is rich in olive oil and monounsaturated fatty acids, in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and possibly protecting against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.

4. **Gut-Brain Axis and Fatty Acids**: The abstract on high-fat diets and the gut-brain axis in obese mice suggests that different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis, potentially influencing metabolic responses and neurological health. This implies that dietary fatty acid composition could indirectly affect the risk or progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Given these points, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be hypothesized as follows:

- **Genetic Influence on Fatty Acid Metabolism**: If the F3 wt Allele influences fatty acid metabolism or the preference for certain types of fatty acids in the diet, it could indirectly affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. For instance, if the allele is associated with a higher intake or metabolism of saturated fatty acids, this could lead to changes in brain phospholipid composition that are detrimental to neuronal health.

- **Dietary Patterns and Genetic Predisposition**: Individuals with the F3 wt Allele might have a genetic predisposition to prefer or metabolize certain dietary fatty acids differently. If this predisposition leads to a higher intake of protective fatty acids (like omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish or monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil), it could offer some protection against cognitive decline. Conversely, a predisposition towards a diet high in saturated fats could increase the risk.

- **Gut-Brain Axis Modulation**: The allele could potentially influence the gut-brain axis by affecting the metabolism or transport of fatty acids, thereby modulating the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. This could occur through changes in the intestinal barrier function, inflammation levels, or the production of neuroactive compounds that influence brain health.

In summary, while the abstracts do not directly link the F3 wt Allele to Alzheimer's Disease, they provide a framework for understanding how genetic factors influencing fatty acid metabolism or dietary preferences could indirectly impact the risk of developing Alzheimer's. This relationship would depend on how the allele affects fatty acid composition in the brain, dietary patterns, and the modulation of the gut-brain axis.",35.84162402153015,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

An Investigation of Calibration Phantoms for CT Scanners with Tube Voltage Modulation. The effects of calibration phantoms on the correction results of the empirical artifacts correction method (ECCU) for the case of tube modulation were investigated. To improve the validity of the ECCU method, the effect of the geometry parameter of a typical single-material calibration phantom (water calibration phantom) on the ECCU algorithm was investigated. Dual-material calibration phantoms (such as water-bone calibration phantom), geometry arrangement, and the area-ratio of dual-material calibration phantoms were also studied. Preliminary results implied that, to assure the effectiveness of the ECCU algorithm, the polychromatic projections of calibration phantoms must cover the polychromatic projection data of the scanning object. However, the projection range of a water calibration phantom is limited by the scan field of view (SFOV), thus leading to methodological limitations. A dual-material phantom of a proper size and material can overcome the limitations of a single-material phantom and achieve good correction effects.

The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's disease. This implies that renal impairment may be a risk factor for AD.
2. **Vascular Compromise and Alzheimer's Disease**: The second abstract highlights the role of cerebrovasculature and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in the development and progression of AD. Vascular compromise, including diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease, can lead to subclinical BBB breakdown, which may contribute to AD.
3. **Homocysteine and Vascular Disease**: The abstracts on homocysteine (e.g., ""Homocysteine: overview of biochemistry, molecular biology, and role in disease processes"") suggest that elevated homocysteine levels are associated with vascular disease, including cardiovascular disease and stroke, which are risk factors for AD.
4. **Methionine and Homocysteine Metabolism**: The abstract ""Methionine restriction delays aging-related urogenital diseases in male Fischer 344 rats"" implies that methionine restriction can delay age-related diseases, including renal disease. Methionine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in homocysteine metabolism.
5. **F3 Gene and Coagulation**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, the F3 gene (also known as the tissue factor gene) is involved in coagulation. Tissue factor is a key initiator of the coagulation cascade, and its expression is influenced by various factors, including homocysteine.
6. **Indirect Link between F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease**: Considering the above points, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the following pathway:
	* The F3 wt Allele influences coagulation and vascular function, potentially leading to vascular compromise.
	* Vascular compromise, in turn, contributes to renal impairment and increased homocysteine levels.
	* Elevated homocysteine levels exacerbate vascular disease, including cardiovascular disease and stroke, which are risk factors for AD.
	* Renal impairment and vascular disease can lead to subclinical BBB breakdown, ultimately contributing to the development and progression of AD.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve a complex interplay between coagulation, vascular function, renal impairment, homocysteine metabolism, and BBB dysfunction. However, it is essential to note that this narrative is speculative and based on the provided abstracts, which do not directly investigate the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Alcohol expectancies longitudinally predict drinking and the alcohol myopia effects of relief, self-inflation, and excess. Alcohol myopia theory posits that alcohol consumption attenuates information processing capacity, and that expectancy beliefs together with intake level are responsible for experiences in myopic effects (relief, self-inflation, and excess). Adults (N=413) averaging 36.39 (SD=13.02) years of age completed the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire at baseline, followed by alcohol use measures (frequency and quantity) and the Alcohol Myopia Scale one month later. Three structural equation models based on differing construct manifestations of alcohol expectancies served to longitudinally forecast alcohol use and myopia. In Model 1, overall expectancy predicted greater alcohol use and higher levels of all three myopic effects. In Model 2, specifying separate positive and negative expectancy factors, positive but not negative expectancy predicted greater use. Furthermore, positive expectancy and use explained higher myopic relief and higher self-inflation, whereas positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and use explained higher myopic excess. In Model 3, the seven specific expectancy subscales (sociability, tension reduction, liquid courage, sexuality, cognitive and behavioral impairment, risk and aggression, and self-perception) were simultaneously specified as predictors. Tension reduction expectancy, sexuality expectancy, and use contributed to higher myopic relief; sexuality expectancy and use explained higher myopic self-inflation; and risk and aggression expectancy and use accounted for higher myopic excess. Across all three predictive models, the total variance explained ranged from 12 to 19% for alcohol use, 50 to 51% for relief, 29 to 34% for self-inflation, and 32 to 35% for excess. Findings support that the type of alcohol myopia experienced is a concurrent function of self-fulfilling alcohol prophecies and drinking levels. The interpreted measurement manifestation of expectancy yielded different prevention implications.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Vascular Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's disease, implying a link between renal function and AD. Vascular disease, which is influenced by renal function, is also a known risk factor for AD.
2. **Vascular Compromise and Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Breakdown**: The second abstract highlights the role of vascular compromise in the development and progression of AD. The breakdown of the BBB, which can be caused by vascular complications, is thought to precede and drive the pathological changes leading to symptomatic AD.
3. **Oxidative Stress and Inflammation**: The third abstract discusses the involvement of soluble and deposited melanins, their intermediates, and reactive oxygen side-products in human diseases, including Alzheimer's. Oxidative stress and inflammation, which are associated with melanin formation, may contribute to the development of AD.
4. **Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGEs) and Oxidative Stress**: The fourth abstract mentions the role of AGEs in several pathophysiologies, including Alzheimer's disease. AGEs can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, which may contribute to the development of AD.
5. **Uric Acid and Oxidative Stress**: The fifth abstract notes that altered uric acid levels are associated with various disease states, including Alzheimer's. Uric acid can act as an antioxidant, but elevated levels may also contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation.
6. **Homocysteine and Vascular Disease**: The sixth and seventh abstracts discuss the role of homocysteine in vascular disease and thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a known risk factor for AD.
7. **Glycine Betaine and Methylation**: The eighth abstract mentions the role of glycine betaine in methylation processes and its potential impact on various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like AD.
8. **Methionine Restriction and Aging-Related Diseases**: The ninth abstract suggests that methionine restriction may delay aging-related diseases, including chronic progressive nephropathy and testicular tumorigenesis. Methionine is an amino acid involved in homocysteine metabolism, and its restriction may have implications for AD risk.
9. **Homocysteine and Tissue Factor Activity**: The tenth abstract notes that homocysteine can induce tissue factor activity in endothelial cells, leading to coagulation and thrombosis. This process may contribute to the development of vascular disease and, indirectly, AD.

Connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be:

* The F3 wt Allele may influence renal function, which is associated with vascular disease and, in turn, AD risk.
* Vascular compromise and BBB breakdown, which are linked to AD, may be influenced by factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and AGEs.
* Homocysteine, which is involved in vascular disease and thrombosis, may be influenced by methionine metabolism and glycine betaine.
* Uric acid, which has antioxidant properties, may also contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially influencing AD risk.
* Methionine restriction, which may delay aging-related diseases, could have implications for AD risk by influencing homocysteine metabolism and vascular health.

While this narrative provides a possible indirect link between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease, it is essential to note that the relationships between these entities are complex and influenced by multiple factors. Further research is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and to determine the significance of the F3 wt Allele in AD risk.",28.509257316589355,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's Disease, implying a link between renal function and AD. This connection could be mediated by vascular disease, which is a known risk factor for AD.

2. **Homocysteine and Vascular Disease**: Elevated homocysteine levels are a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, as mentioned in several abstracts. Homocysteine can induce tissue factor activity in endothelial cells, contributing to coagulation and vascular disease.

3. **F3 Gene and Homocysteine**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided abstracts, the F3 gene (also known as the factor III or tissue factor gene) plays a crucial role in coagulation. Variants of the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence homocysteine levels or its effects on vascular disease. For example, if the F3 wt Allele affects tissue factor expression or activity, it could modulate the pro-coagulant effects of homocysteine.

4. **Vascular Disease and Alzheimer's Disease**: Vascular disease is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease. The connection between homocysteine, vascular disease, and AD could be mediated by the F3 gene, which influences coagulation and, subsequently, vascular health.

5. **Additional Intermediate Factors**: Other factors, such as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), oxidative stress, and inflammation, might also contribute to the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease. For example, AGEs can accumulate in vascular tissues and contribute to vascular disease, which is a risk factor for AD.

6. **Nutritional and Environmental Factors**: The abstracts also highlight the importance of nutritional and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and exposure to toxins, in modulating the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease. For instance, a diet rich in antioxidants and flavonoids, such as rutin, might help mitigate the effects of homocysteine and vascular disease on AD risk.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve a complex interplay of factors, including:

* Renal function and vascular disease
* Homocysteine and its effects on coagulation and vascular disease
* The F3 gene and its influence on tissue factor expression and activity
* Additional intermediate factors, such as AGEs, oxidative stress, and inflammation
* Nutritional and environmental factors, such as diet and physical activity

While the provided abstracts do not directly link the F3 wt Allele to Alzheimer's Disease, they suggest a possible narrative that involves multiple intermediate entities and processes.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's disease, implying a link between renal function and AD. This connection could be mediated by vascular disease, which is a known risk factor for AD.

2. **Homocysteine and Methionine Metabolism**: The abstracts on homocysteine and methionine restriction highlight the importance of these amino acids in disease processes. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and potentially AD. Methionine restriction has been shown to delay aging-related diseases, including renal disease, in animal models.

3. **Glycine Betaine and Disease**: Glycine betaine, which is involved in methionine metabolism, has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and renal diseases. Its role as an antioxidant, methyl donor, and regulator of homocysteine levels could contribute to the development or progression of AD.

4. **Uric Acid and Disease**: Altered uric acid levels have been linked to several disease states, including AD. Uric acid may play a role in the development or progression of these diseases, and its manipulation is being investigated as a potential treatment.

5. **Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract on diabetes and AD highlights the potential link between hyperglycemia, glucotoxicity, and cognitive impairment. Diabetes-related cognitive impairment may share common mechanisms with AD, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism dysregulation.

6. **F3 wt Allele and Coagulation**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided abstracts, the F3 gene is involved in coagulation, and variations in this gene could potentially influence the risk of thrombotic events, which are associated with AD.

Connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be:

* The F3 wt Allele influences coagulation and thrombotic risk, which is associated with cardiovascular disease and renal disease.
* Cardiovascular and renal disease are risk factors for AD, potentially through shared vascular mechanisms or the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as homocysteine.
* Homocysteine and methionine metabolism, which are influenced by glycine betaine and other factors, play a role in the development or progression of AD.
* Uric acid and diabetes-related metabolic dysregulation may also contribute to the development or progression of AD, potentially through inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism dysregulation.

In summary, the F3 wt Allele may indirectly influence the risk of Alzheimer's Disease through its effects on coagulation, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, which are associated with AD through shared vascular mechanisms, toxic metabolites, and metabolic dysregulation. However, this narrative is speculative and requires further research to confirm the relationships between these entities and processes.",35.84162402153015,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

An Investigation of Calibration Phantoms for CT Scanners with Tube Voltage Modulation. The effects of calibration phantoms on the correction results of the empirical artifacts correction method (ECCU) for the case of tube modulation were investigated. To improve the validity of the ECCU method, the effect of the geometry parameter of a typical single-material calibration phantom (water calibration phantom) on the ECCU algorithm was investigated. Dual-material calibration phantoms (such as water-bone calibration phantom), geometry arrangement, and the area-ratio of dual-material calibration phantoms were also studied. Preliminary results implied that, to assure the effectiveness of the ECCU algorithm, the polychromatic projections of calibration phantoms must cover the polychromatic projection data of the scanning object. However, the projection range of a water calibration phantom is limited by the scan field of view (SFOV), thus leading to methodological limitations. A dual-material phantom of a proper size and material can overcome the limitations of a single-material phantom and achieve good correction effects.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Immune system dysregulation**: AD is associated with immune system changes, and genes like CD2AP, BIN1, and CLU are implicated in immune system dysfunction. The F3 gene, also known as the coagulation factor III gene, is involved in the coagulation cascade and has been linked to inflammation and immune responses.
2. **Coagulation and inflammation**: The F3 gene is associated with the production of tissue factor (TF), which is a transmembrane receptor that triggers coagulation and inflammation. TF has been shown to play a role in AD pathogenesis, and its expression is increased in AD brains.
3. **Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal dynamics**: Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, are involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and are implicated in AD. The F3 gene has been linked to Rho GTPase signaling, and alterations in Rho GTPase activity have been observed in AD.
4. **Podocyte injury and kidney disease**: Podocyte injury is a key event in proteinuric kidney disease, and genes like CD2AP and synaptopodin are involved in maintaining podocyte integrity. The F3 gene has been linked to kidney disease, and alterations in F3 expression have been observed in podocyte injury models.
5. **Epithelial cell polarity and junctions**: The PAR polarity complex, which includes CD2AP, is involved in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. The F3 gene has been linked to epithelial cell polarity and junctions, and alterations in F3 expression have been observed in models of epithelial cell dysfunction.

The possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD could be summarized as follows:

* The F3 wt Allele influences coagulation and inflammation through the production of tissue factor (TF), which is increased in AD brains.
* TF triggers coagulation and inflammation, leading to immune system dysregulation, which is a hallmark of AD.
* Immune system dysregulation and inflammation contribute to the disruption of cytoskeletal dynamics, which is regulated by Rho GTPases.
* Rho GTPase dysregulation contributes to podocyte injury and kidney disease, which are associated with AD.
* Podocyte injury and kidney disease lead to the disruption of epithelial cell polarity and junctions, which are critical for maintaining the blood-brain barrier and preventing AD-related neurodegeneration.

While this narrative provides a possible indirect link between the F3 wt Allele and AD, it is essential to note that the relationship between these entities is complex and likely involves multiple intermediate processes and genes. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this potential relationship.",39.19556903839111,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Couples-based interventions following prostate cancer treatment: a narrative review. Sexual dysfunction following prostate cancer (PC) treatment often results in sexual avoidance and a loss of sexual intimacy, which can lead to relationship distress. This review aims to evaluate six studies intended to address relational and sexual intimacy following PC treatment and discuss methodological concerns which may help produce more effective interventions. Electronic databases used to conduct literature searches included Medline, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using samples of men diagnosed with PC of any stage, had a psychosocial intervention, and addressed at least one sexual and relational outcome. As a whole, the literature has produced mixed results. While significant findings were reported, many of the primary hypotheses were not achieved. The six studies show that men with PC may benefit from education and support related to treatment options for erectile dysfunction (ED), whereas their partners may benefit more from interventions focused on relational issues. Important methodological limitations included: selection of general outcome measures as opposed to measures specific to sexuality or intimacy outcomes, lack of assessing distress or bother of the patient/couples as study entry criteria, heterogeneity of study populations, and lack of innovative intervention content as the current studies tested standard educational interventions, sex therapies techniques, and couples therapy strategies with only marginal success. Interventions based on innovative theoretical approaches as well as study designs that address the outlined methodological limitations are needed in this area.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Relaxin's induction of metalloproteinases is associated with the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in synovial joint fibrocartilaginous explants. Diseases of specific fibrocartilaginous joints are especially common in women of reproductive age, suggesting that female hormones contribute to their etiopathogenesis. Previously, we showed that relaxin dose-dependently induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in isolated joint fibrocartilaginous cells. Here we determined the effects of relaxin with or without beta-estradiol on the modulation of MMPs in joint fibrocartilaginous explants, and assessed the contribution of these proteinases to the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in this tissue. Fibrocartilaginous discs from temporomandibular joints of female rabbits were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing relaxin (0.1 ng/ml) or beta-estradiol (20 ng/ml) or relaxin plus beta-estradiol. Additional experiments were done in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or its control analog. After 48 hours of culture, the medium was assayed for MMPs and the discs were analyzed for collagen and GAG concentrations. Relaxin and beta-estradiol plus relaxin induced the MMPs collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 in fibrocartilaginous explants--a finding similar to that which we observed in pubic symphysis fibrocartilage, but not in articular cartilage explants. The induction of these proteinases by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin was accompanied by a loss of GAGs and collagen in joint fibrocartilage. None of the hormone treatments altered the synthesis of GAGs, suggesting that the loss of this matrix molecule probably resulted from increased matrix degradation. Indeed, fibrocartilaginous explants cultured in the presence of GM6001 showed an inhibition of relaxin-induced and beta-estradiol plus relaxin-induced collagenase and stromelysin activities to control baseline levels that were accompanied by the maintenance of collagen or GAG content at control levels. These findings show for the first time that relaxin has degradative effects on non-reproductive synovial joint fibrocartilaginous tissue and provide evidence for a link between relaxin, MMPs, and matrix degradation.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Immune system dysregulation**: AD is associated with immune system changes, and genes like CLU, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7, HLA-DRB1, TREM2, EPHA1, and CD2AP are implicated in immune system dysfunction (Abstract 3). The F3 gene, also known as coagulation factor III, is involved in the coagulation cascade and has been linked to inflammation and immune responses.
2. **Coagulation and inflammation**: Tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane receptor, plays a crucial role in coagulation and inflammation (Abstracts 8 and 9). TF is also involved in cell signaling and can regulate smooth muscle cell migration. The F3 gene product, tissue factor, might interact with other proteins and pathways involved in AD, such as the immune system and inflammation.
3. **CD2AP and cytoskeletal regulation**: CD2AP, a protein associated with AD risk, is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion (Abstracts 4 and 5). CD2AP interacts with other proteins, such as synaptopodin, to maintain podocyte structure and function. The F3 gene might influence CD2AP expression or activity, either directly or indirectly, through its role in coagulation and inflammation.
4. **Rho GTPase signaling**: Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, are essential for regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and inflammation (Abstracts 6 and 8). The F3 gene product, tissue factor, might interact with Rho GTPase signaling pathways, influencing AD-related processes like inflammation and cytoskeletal regulation.
5. **Epithelial cell polarity and morphology**: The PAR polarity complex and DAPLE regulate apical actomyosin assembly and epithelial cell morphology (Abstract 7). The F3 gene might influence these processes, either directly or indirectly, through its role in coagulation and inflammation, which could impact AD-related changes in brain morphology and function.

While there is no direct evidence linking the F3 wt Allele to AD in the provided abstracts, the connections between coagulation, inflammation, immune system dysregulation, cytoskeletal regulation, and Rho GTPase signaling provide a possible indirect relationship. The F3 gene might contribute to AD susceptibility through its involvement in these intermediate processes, which are implicated in AD pathogenesis.

To further explore this potential relationship, additional research would be necessary to:

1. Investigate the expression and activity of F3 in AD brains and its potential interaction with AD-related genes and pathways.
2. Examine the role of F3 in regulating immune system function, inflammation, and coagulation in the context of AD.
3. Determine whether F3 influences CD2AP expression or activity, and whether this interaction contributes to AD-related changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion.
4. Explore the potential connections between F3, Rho GTPase signaling, and epithelial cell polarity in the context of AD.

By elucidating these relationships, researchers may uncover a novel, indirect link between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease.",42.19934821128845,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Relaxin's induction of metalloproteinases is associated with the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in synovial joint fibrocartilaginous explants. Diseases of specific fibrocartilaginous joints are especially common in women of reproductive age, suggesting that female hormones contribute to their etiopathogenesis. Previously, we showed that relaxin dose-dependently induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in isolated joint fibrocartilaginous cells. Here we determined the effects of relaxin with or without beta-estradiol on the modulation of MMPs in joint fibrocartilaginous explants, and assessed the contribution of these proteinases to the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in this tissue. Fibrocartilaginous discs from temporomandibular joints of female rabbits were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing relaxin (0.1 ng/ml) or beta-estradiol (20 ng/ml) or relaxin plus beta-estradiol. Additional experiments were done in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or its control analog. After 48 hours of culture, the medium was assayed for MMPs and the discs were analyzed for collagen and GAG concentrations. Relaxin and beta-estradiol plus relaxin induced the MMPs collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 in fibrocartilaginous explants--a finding similar to that which we observed in pubic symphysis fibrocartilage, but not in articular cartilage explants. The induction of these proteinases by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin was accompanied by a loss of GAGs and collagen in joint fibrocartilage. None of the hormone treatments altered the synthesis of GAGs, suggesting that the loss of this matrix molecule probably resulted from increased matrix degradation. Indeed, fibrocartilaginous explants cultured in the presence of GM6001 showed an inhibition of relaxin-induced and beta-estradiol plus relaxin-induced collagenase and stromelysin activities to control baseline levels that were accompanied by the maintenance of collagen or GAG content at control levels. These findings show for the first time that relaxin has degradative effects on non-reproductive synovial joint fibrocartilaginous tissue and provide evidence for a link between relaxin, MMPs, and matrix degradation.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **CD2AP as a common link**: CD2AP is identified as a susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's Disease in multiple abstracts. It is involved in various cellular processes, including axon growth, neurotrophin signaling, and actin cytoskeleton regulation.
2. **F3 gene and coagulation**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, the F3 gene (also known as the tissue factor gene) plays a crucial role in coagulation. Tissue factor is the primary initiator of blood coagulation, and its expression is regulated by various factors, including RhoA activation.
3. **RhoA activation and cytoskeleton regulation**: RhoA activation is mentioned in several abstracts as a key regulator of cytoskeleton dynamics, including actin polymerization and filopodia formation. This process is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell shape and function.
4. **CD2AP and RhoA interaction**: CD2AP is shown to interact with RhoA and regulate its activity, which in turn affects the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction may be relevant to the development of Alzheimer's Disease, as dysregulation of the cytoskeleton has been implicated in AD pathogenesis.
5. **Inflammation and immune response**: Several abstracts highlight the importance of inflammation and immune response in Alzheimer's Disease. CD2AP is involved in regulating immune cell function, and its dysregulation may contribute to the inflammatory processes observed in AD.
6. **APOE and lipid metabolism**: APOE is a well-established risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease, and its variants (e.g., APOE4) are associated with disrupted lipid metabolism. CD2AP has been shown to interact with APOE, and its expression is correlated with APOE in breast tumors.
7. **Indirect link between F3 wt Allele and AD**: Although the F3 gene is not directly mentioned in the context of Alzheimer's Disease, its product, tissue factor, is involved in coagulation and may interact with CD2AP and RhoA. The F3 wt Allele may influence the expression or activity of tissue factor, which in turn affects the coagulation cascade and potentially contributes to the development of Alzheimer's Disease through the intermediate entities and processes mentioned above.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve the following pathway:

F3 wt Allele → Tissue factor expression/activity → RhoA activation → CD2AP regulation → Cytoskeleton dynamics and inflammation → APOE and lipid metabolism → Alzheimer's Disease

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Triple Philadelphia chromosomes with major-bcr rearrangement in hypotriploid erythroleukaemia. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), especially subtypes M1 and M2 in the French-American-British classification. We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.","{('C0076080', 'C1506592'): ['23243055', '33085768', '16908595', '7364749', '19251725'], ('C1506592', 'C2713871'): ['22966358', '17400210', '30486894', '30790678', '17780482'], ('C2713871', 'C1530270'): ['28039298', '17449800', '8576749', '13370798', '11007054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1506592'), 'dropped': '7364749', 'added': '17152096'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C1506592')",7364749,17152096

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Genetic risk factors for AD**: The abstracts mention several genetic risk factors for AD, including ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33, and CD2AP. These genes are associated with various biological processes, such as lipid processing, immune response, and synaptic cell function, which are disrupted in AD.
2. **CD2AP and its role in AD**: CD2AP is a gene that has been consistently associated with AD risk. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and has been shown to interact with other proteins, such as synaptopodin, to maintain the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton.
3. **Synaptopodin and podocyte function**: Synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Podocytes are specialized cells in the kidney that are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. Disruption of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton can lead to proteinuria and kidney damage.
4. **Rho GTPases and cytoskeleton regulation**: Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and are involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and adhesion.
5. **F3 gene and coagulation**: The F3 gene encodes for tissue factor (TF), which is a transmembrane receptor that initiates the coagulation cascade. TF is also involved in cell signaling and has been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.
6. **Potential link between F3 wt Allele and AD**: Although there is no direct mention of the F3 wt Allele in the abstracts, it is possible that the F3 gene, through its role in coagulation and cell signaling, may interact with other genes and pathways that are associated with AD risk. For example, the F3 gene may regulate the expression or activity of CD2AP or synaptopodin, which are involved in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Disruption of this process could contribute to the development of AD.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD might exist through the following pathway:

F3 wt Allele → regulation of coagulation and cell signaling → interaction with CD2AP and synaptopodin → disruption of podocyte actin cytoskeleton → contribution to AD pathogenesis

This narrative is highly speculative and requires further research to confirm the potential link between the F3 wt Allele and AD. However, it highlights the complexity of the biological processes involved in AD and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective therapeutic strategies.",39.023563385009766,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Optimization of phosphopeptide elution conditions in immobilized Fe(III) affinity chromatography. While immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has been widely used for affinity purification of phosphopeptides, the technique suffers from insufficient specificity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for IMAC optimization to yield the selectivity and sensitivity that is required for more challenging analyses. Recently, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and phosphoric acid mixture has been reported as an efficient IMAC eluant. The disadvantage of DHB is that is not suitable for electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. While further developing the IMAC elution protocol to overcome this problem, we noticed that DHB is not necessary and found a novel combination of phosphoric acid and acetonitrile to be more efficient. The purification efficacy of the novel protocol is superior to all previously described methods, while still being compatible with the most commonly used mass-spectrometric techniques in phosphoproteomics.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Triple Philadelphia chromosomes with major-bcr rearrangement in hypotriploid erythroleukaemia. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), especially subtypes M1 and M2 in the French-American-British classification. We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.","{('C0076080', 'C1506592'): ['23243055', '33085768', '16908595', '19251725', '17152096'], ('C1506592', 'C2713871'): ['22966358', '17400210', '30486894', '30790678', '17780482'], ('C2713871', 'C1530270'): ['28039298', '17449800', '8576749', '13370798', '11007054']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

Although none of the abstracts directly mention the F3 wt Allele, we can infer potential connections through the discussion of related biological processes and risk factors associated with Alzheimer's Disease.

1. **Inflammation and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract discusses the link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), highlighting shared molecular processes and the role of inflammation. Elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 are associated with both conditions. This suggests that factors influencing inflammatory pathways could indirectly affect the risk or progression of Alzheimer's Disease.

2. **Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease**: The second abstract explores the relationship between serum lipid levels (such as total cholesterol and LDL-C) and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's Disease. It finds that higher levels of TC and LDL-C are associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. This implies that genetic or environmental factors affecting lipid metabolism could have an indirect impact on Alzheimer's Disease risk.

3. **Obesity, Inflammation, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The fourth and fifth abstracts touch on obesity and its metabolic consequences, including inflammation and alterations in lipid profiles. Obesity is known to increase the risk of developing T2DM and may also have a link to Alzheimer's Disease through shared pathways involving inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

4. **Homocysteine, Folate, and Vascular Health**: The abstract on homocysteine highlights its role as a risk factor for vascular disease and thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels can lead to endothelial dysfunction and are associated with decreased folate levels, which might indirectly influence cognitive health and potentially the risk of Alzheimer's Disease through vascular mechanisms.

5. **Genetic Factors and Metabolic Pathways**: Although not directly mentioned, genetic factors like the F3 wt Allele could influence metabolic pathways, inflammation, and vascular health. For instance, if the F3 wt Allele affects lipid metabolism, homocysteine levels, or inflammatory responses, it could indirectly influence the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist if the allele influences any of the following:

- **Lipid Metabolism**: By affecting TC and LDL-C levels, thereby increasing the risk of cognitive impairment.
- **Inflammatory Pathways**: By modulating the levels of inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, which are associated with both T2DM and Alzheimer's Disease.
- **Homocysteine Levels**: By impacting folate metabolism or directly influencing homocysteine levels, thereby affecting vascular health and potentially cognitive function.
- **Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome**: By contributing to the development of obesity or metabolic syndrome, which are linked to increased risks of T2DM and possibly Alzheimer's Disease through inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

In conclusion, while the abstracts do not directly address the F3 wt Allele, they provide insights into potential indirect pathways through which genetic factors influencing metabolism, inflammation, and vascular health could impact the risk of Alzheimer's Disease. Further research would be necessary to establish a specific connection between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease.",39.19556903839111,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Couples-based interventions following prostate cancer treatment: a narrative review. Sexual dysfunction following prostate cancer (PC) treatment often results in sexual avoidance and a loss of sexual intimacy, which can lead to relationship distress. This review aims to evaluate six studies intended to address relational and sexual intimacy following PC treatment and discuss methodological concerns which may help produce more effective interventions. Electronic databases used to conduct literature searches included Medline, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using samples of men diagnosed with PC of any stage, had a psychosocial intervention, and addressed at least one sexual and relational outcome. As a whole, the literature has produced mixed results. While significant findings were reported, many of the primary hypotheses were not achieved. The six studies show that men with PC may benefit from education and support related to treatment options for erectile dysfunction (ED), whereas their partners may benefit more from interventions focused on relational issues. Important methodological limitations included: selection of general outcome measures as opposed to measures specific to sexuality or intimacy outcomes, lack of assessing distress or bother of the patient/couples as study entry criteria, heterogeneity of study populations, and lack of innovative intervention content as the current studies tested standard educational interventions, sex therapies techniques, and couples therapy strategies with only marginal success. Interventions based on innovative theoretical approaches as well as study designs that address the outlined methodological limitations are needed in this area.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Relaxin's induction of metalloproteinases is associated with the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in synovial joint fibrocartilaginous explants. Diseases of specific fibrocartilaginous joints are especially common in women of reproductive age, suggesting that female hormones contribute to their etiopathogenesis. Previously, we showed that relaxin dose-dependently induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in isolated joint fibrocartilaginous cells. Here we determined the effects of relaxin with or without beta-estradiol on the modulation of MMPs in joint fibrocartilaginous explants, and assessed the contribution of these proteinases to the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in this tissue. Fibrocartilaginous discs from temporomandibular joints of female rabbits were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing relaxin (0.1 ng/ml) or beta-estradiol (20 ng/ml) or relaxin plus beta-estradiol. Additional experiments were done in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or its control analog. After 48 hours of culture, the medium was assayed for MMPs and the discs were analyzed for collagen and GAG concentrations. Relaxin and beta-estradiol plus relaxin induced the MMPs collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 in fibrocartilaginous explants--a finding similar to that which we observed in pubic symphysis fibrocartilage, but not in articular cartilage explants. The induction of these proteinases by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin was accompanied by a loss of GAGs and collagen in joint fibrocartilage. None of the hormone treatments altered the synthesis of GAGs, suggesting that the loss of this matrix molecule probably resulted from increased matrix degradation. Indeed, fibrocartilaginous explants cultured in the presence of GM6001 showed an inhibition of relaxin-induced and beta-estradiol plus relaxin-induced collagenase and stromelysin activities to control baseline levels that were accompanied by the maintenance of collagen or GAG content at control levels. These findings show for the first time that relaxin has degradative effects on non-reproductive synovial joint fibrocartilaginous tissue and provide evidence for a link between relaxin, MMPs, and matrix degradation.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

1. **Link between Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study"" suggests that higher levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This implies that lipid metabolism plays a role in the pathophysiology of AD.

2. **Influence of Diet on Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease**: The study ""Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats"" indicates that dietary components, specifically monounsaturated fats (like those found in olive oil), can reduce hepatic lipid content. This reduction in lipid levels could potentially lower the risk of developing AD, given the association between high lipid levels and AD.

3. **Obesity, Inflammation, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity"" discusses how obesity leads to chronic inflammation and immune activation, which can contribute to the development of AD. Obesity is also linked to alterations in lipid metabolism, further connecting it to AD risk.

4. **Homocysteine, Vascular Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The study ""Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells"" shows that elevated homocysteine levels, often associated with folate deficiency, can lead to vascular disease and potentially increase the risk of AD, as vascular factors are known to contribute to AD pathology.

5. **F3 Gene and Lipid Metabolism**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided abstracts, the F3 gene (encoding tissue factor) is involved in coagulation and has been implicated in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Variants of the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, could potentially influence an individual's lipid profile and, by extension, their risk of developing AD.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could exist through the following pathway:

- The F3 wt Allele influences lipid metabolism, potentially leading to higher levels of TC and LDL-C.
- Elevated TC and LDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease.
- Dietary factors and obesity, which are linked to lipid metabolism, can also modulate the risk of AD through inflammation and other mechanisms.
- Homocysteine levels, affected by folate status and potentially by genetic factors like the F3 gene, contribute to vascular disease and may indirectly influence AD risk.

This narrative suggests that the F3 wt Allele could indirectly contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's Disease by affecting lipid metabolism, which in turn is associated with AD. However, this relationship is speculative and based on connecting findings from different studies. Direct research on the F3 gene and its variants in the context of Alzheimer's Disease would be necessary to confirm such a relationship.",42.19934821128845,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Relaxin's induction of metalloproteinases is associated with the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in synovial joint fibrocartilaginous explants. Diseases of specific fibrocartilaginous joints are especially common in women of reproductive age, suggesting that female hormones contribute to their etiopathogenesis. Previously, we showed that relaxin dose-dependently induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in isolated joint fibrocartilaginous cells. Here we determined the effects of relaxin with or without beta-estradiol on the modulation of MMPs in joint fibrocartilaginous explants, and assessed the contribution of these proteinases to the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in this tissue. Fibrocartilaginous discs from temporomandibular joints of female rabbits were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing relaxin (0.1 ng/ml) or beta-estradiol (20 ng/ml) or relaxin plus beta-estradiol. Additional experiments were done in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or its control analog. After 48 hours of culture, the medium was assayed for MMPs and the discs were analyzed for collagen and GAG concentrations. Relaxin and beta-estradiol plus relaxin induced the MMPs collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 in fibrocartilaginous explants--a finding similar to that which we observed in pubic symphysis fibrocartilage, but not in articular cartilage explants. The induction of these proteinases by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin was accompanied by a loss of GAGs and collagen in joint fibrocartilage. None of the hormone treatments altered the synthesis of GAGs, suggesting that the loss of this matrix molecule probably resulted from increased matrix degradation. Indeed, fibrocartilaginous explants cultured in the presence of GM6001 showed an inhibition of relaxin-induced and beta-estradiol plus relaxin-induced collagenase and stromelysin activities to control baseline levels that were accompanied by the maintenance of collagen or GAG content at control levels. These findings show for the first time that relaxin has degradative effects on non-reproductive synovial joint fibrocartilaginous tissue and provide evidence for a link between relaxin, MMPs, and matrix degradation.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

1589,C0002395 C1705607,F3 wt Allele,Alzheimer's Disease,35950105,"Quality of dietary fat and risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia in adults aged >=50 years: a systematic review. To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes.

1. **Lipid Metabolism and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study"" suggests that high levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is involved in lipid metabolism, and variations in this gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence lipid profiles, potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

2. **Inflammation and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease"" highlights the link between inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. An indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease might exist through the modulation of inflammatory pathways, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

3. **Homocysteine and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells"" suggests that elevated homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and thrombosis, which are also risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of homocysteine levels, and variations in this gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence homocysteine metabolism, potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

4. **Obesity and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity"" highlights the link between obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Obesity is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and the F3 gene is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. An indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease might exist through the modulation of obesity-related pathways, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease might exist through the modulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, homocysteine levels, and obesity-related pathways, which are all known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Triple Philadelphia chromosomes with major-bcr rearrangement in hypotriploid erythroleukaemia. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), especially subtypes M1 and M2 in the French-American-British classification. We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.","{('C0076080', 'C1506592'): ['23243055', '33085768', '16908595', '7364749', '19251725'], ('C1506592', 'C2713871'): ['22966358', '17400210', '30486894', '30790678', '17780482'], ('C2713871', 'C1530270'): ['28039298', '17449800', '8576749', '13370798', '11007054']}","{'edge': ('C0076080', 'C1506592'), 'dropped': '7364749', 'added': '17152096'}",3,"('C0076080', 'C1506592')",7364749,17152096

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize evidence on the effect of quality of dietary fat intake and different classes of fatty acids on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia in adults aged >=50 years. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for clinical trials and prospective cohort studies published until May 2021. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved literature, extracted relevant data, and performed risk of bias assessment. Classes of fatty acids included were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), trans fatty acids (TFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and their subtypes and sources. Given between-study heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analyses but narratively described findings from the studies. From 4,491 identified records, five articles (based on four prospective cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies had an overall serious risk of bias, while one study had a moderate risk. Overall, we found no robust association between intake of any fatty acids type and the development of AD and dementia. For example, for SFA and TFA, there was contradictory associations reported on AD: one study found that each unit increase in energy-adjusted intake of SFA (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98) and TFA (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97) was associated with a decreased risk of AD, but not dementia. For PUFA, one study found that higher quintile intake of marine-based n-3 PUFA was associated with a decreased risk of AD. The intake of other fatty acids was not associated with the outcomes. The certainty of the overall evidence was inconclusive. We found no clear association between the intake of various classes of fatty acids and the risk of AD and dementia in adults. More well-designed prospective studies are required to clarify these findings.

1. **Link between Lipid Metabolism and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study"" suggests that elevated serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This implies that dysregulation in lipid metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.

2. **Influence of Diet on Lipid Metabolism and Inflammation**: The abstract ""Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats"" indicates that dietary components, such as monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil), can reduce hepatic lipid content and potentially influence inflammation in the body. This is relevant because inflammation is a known factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

3. **Connection between Inflammation, Immune Response, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract ""Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease"" highlights the connection between inflammation and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that managing inflammatory pathways could be beneficial in treating AD.

4. **Role of Homocysteine in Vascular Disease and Potential Link to Alzheimer's**: The abstract ""Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells"" shows that homocysteine, an amino acid linked to vascular disease, can induce tissue factor activity, potentially leading to thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels have also been associated with Alzheimer's disease, possibly through vascular mechanisms or direct neurotoxic effects.

5. **F3 Gene and Coagulation**: The F3 gene encodes for tissue factor, which is crucial in the initiation of blood coagulation. Variants of the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, could potentially influence coagulation pathways and, by extension, affect vascular health and the risk of vascular-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be proposed as follows:

- The F3 wt Allele influences tissue factor expression and, consequently, blood coagulation.
- Altered coagulation pathways can affect vascular health, potentially leading to conditions like atherosclerosis.
- Atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia (elevated TC and LDL-C levels) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, possibly through inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms.
- Dietary factors and metabolic conditions (like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) that influence lipid metabolism and inflammation could further modulate this risk.

In summary, while the F3 wt Allele may not directly cause Alzheimer's disease, its potential impact on coagulation and vascular health, combined with the known associations between vascular disease, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and Alzheimer's disease, suggests an indirect relationship. This relationship is mediated by intermediate factors such as lipid metabolism dysregulation, inflammation, and vascular health.",39.023563385009766,"Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially ""drugable"" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Optimization of phosphopeptide elution conditions in immobilized Fe(III) affinity chromatography. While immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has been widely used for affinity purification of phosphopeptides, the technique suffers from insufficient specificity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for IMAC optimization to yield the selectivity and sensitivity that is required for more challenging analyses. Recently, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and phosphoric acid mixture has been reported as an efficient IMAC eluant. The disadvantage of DHB is that is not suitable for electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. While further developing the IMAC elution protocol to overcome this problem, we noticed that DHB is not necessary and found a novel combination of phosphoric acid and acetonitrile to be more efficient. The purification efficacy of the novel protocol is superior to all previously described methods, while still being compatible with the most commonly used mass-spectrometric techniques in phosphoproteomics.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Triple Philadelphia chromosomes with major-bcr rearrangement in hypotriploid erythroleukaemia. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), especially subtypes M1 and M2 in the French-American-British classification. We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.","{('C0076080', 'C1506592'): ['23243055', '33085768', '16908595', '19251725', '17152096'], ('C1506592', 'C2713871'): ['22966358', '17400210', '30486894', '30790678', '17780482'], ('C2713871', 'C1530270'): ['28039298', '17449800', '8576749', '13370798', '11007054']}","{'edge': 'max_iteration', 'dropped': 'max_iteration', 'added': 'max_iteration'}",4,max_iteration,max_iteration,max_iteration

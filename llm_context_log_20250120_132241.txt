Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

First-line treatment of malignant glioma with carmustine implants followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy: a multicenter experience. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in 44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10.8 years) with glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%) had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0 months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%) experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention strategies for multimodal treatments.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed as follows:

1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and proliferation. The effectiveness of temozolomide is influenced by the activity of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme, which can repair the DNA damage caused by temozolomide.

2. **MGMT and IRF1 connection**: The abstract "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" mentions that methionine stress can inhibit the growth of brain tumor xenografts and enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide. This is associated with the downregulation of MGMT expression. Additionally, methionine stress upregulates IRF-1, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune responses.

3. **IRF1's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis**: IRF1 is known to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Its upregulation can lead to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.

4. **Temozolomide's effect on IRF1**: Although there is no direct mention of temozolomide's effect on IRF1 in the provided abstracts, it can be inferred that temozolomide's ability to induce DNA damage and activate cell cycle checkpoints may lead to the upregulation of IRF1. This is because IRF1 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

5. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Based on the above points, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 can be proposed. Temozolomide's DNA damaging effects can lead to the upregulation of IRF1, either directly or through the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair mechanisms. The upregulation of IRF1 can, in turn, contribute to the inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation, enhancing the efficacy of temozolomide.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, involves the following steps:

Temozolomide → DNA damage → Cell cycle checkpoint activation → IRF1 upregulation → Inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation

This proposed relationship highlights the potential for IRF1 to play a role in the mechanism of action of temozolomide, and further research is needed to fully elucidate this connection.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions.

To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

Liver cell dysplasia in cirrhosis. A serologic and immunohistochemical study. Liver cell dysplasia (LCD) was investigated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ferritin by serologic and immunohistochemical methods in 101 patients with cirrhosis. LCD was found in 30 cases (29.7%), with the highest incidence in cases of posthepatitic cirrhosis (67%). In the group of dysplastic cirrhosis (DC) 46.6% of the patients had active HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serum positivity) compared with 7% of the patients with nondysplastic cirrhosis (NDC) (P less than 0.01). The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed as follows:

1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and proliferation. The effectiveness of temozolomide is influenced by the activity of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme, which can repair the DNA damage caused by temozolomide.

2. **MGMT and IRF1 connection**: The abstract "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" mentions that methionine stress can inhibit the growth of brain tumor xenografts and enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide. This is associated with the upregulation of IRF-1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) among other factors. IRF-1 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

3. **Indirect relationship**: While there is no direct mention of temozolomide inducing IRF1 expression, the connection between temozolomide's mechanism of action and IRF1 can be inferred through the MGMT enzyme. Temozolomide's effectiveness is reduced by MGMT activity. Methionine stress, which can be induced by dietary restriction and administration of methioninase, inhibits MGMT expression and enhances temozolomide's efficacy. This methionine stress also upregulates IRF-1, suggesting that the conditions under which temozolomide is more effective (i.e., low MGMT activity) are also conditions under which IRF-1 is upregulated.

4. **Potential intermediate processes**: The upregulation of IRF-1 in response to methionine stress and its association with enhanced efficacy of temozolomide suggests that IRF-1 could play a role in sensitizing cancer cells to temozolomide. This could occur through various intermediate processes, such as modulation of cell cycle checkpoints, induction of apoptosis, or alteration of DNA repair mechanisms, which are all influenced by IRF-1.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is proposed through the common pathway of MGMT modulation and the effects of methionine stress on both temozolomide efficacy and IRF-1 expression. This relationship suggests that conditions or interventions that upregulate IRF-1 could potentially enhance the effectiveness of temozolomide in cancer treatment.

Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status. A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment, however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Newly diagnosed GBM patients>or=65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal progression. A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82 years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM.

PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency. Information on the mechanisms that are associated with tumor resistance has the potential to provide the fundamental basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In glioblastoma (GBM), predictive biomarkers of cellular responses to temozolomide (TMZ) combined with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) remain largely unidentified. In this context, the influence of MGMT (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) has been studied in addition to the occurrence of synthetic lethality involving PTEN and PARPi. The present study investigated whether PARP-1 inhibition by NU1025 may increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ-induced lesions in GBM cells, and whether these mechanisms can be influenced by MGMT and PTEN status. The impact of PTEN deficiency in repair pathways, and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and PTEN silencing, in terms of synthetic lethality, were also assessed. NU1025 combined with TMZ effectively sensitized TMZ-resistant cells (T98G PTEN-mutated and LN18 PTEN-wild-type) and TMZ-sensitive cells (U251MG PTEN-mutated), in contrast to NU1025 alone. However, the sensitizing effects were not observed in U87MG (PTEN-mutated) cells, suggesting that specific genetic alterations may influence the response to drug treatment. The sensitizing effects occurred independently of MGMT activity, which was evaluated in O6-BG-treated cells. PTEN silencing using small interfering (si)RNA did not sensitize PTEN-proficient cells to TMZ + NU1025, or NU1025 alone, indicating an absence of synthetic lethality. The responses to TMZ + NU1025 involved antiproliferative activity, G2/M arrest, double strand breaks and the induction of apoptosis. Following 20 days of recovery after three consecutive days of TMZ treatment, TMZ-resistant cells were observed. However, when TMZ was combined with NU1025, the viability of T98G and LN18 cells was extremely decreased, indicating a lethal drug combination. Therefore, independently of MGMT proficiency and PTEN status, TMZ combined with PARPi may be a promising strategy that can be used to overcome TMZ acquired resistance in GBM cells.

Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin associated with ovarian fibroma. Benign lymphangiomatous papules of the skin are considered reactive lymphatic proliferations either caused by disruption of the lymphatic flow or tissue damage produced by operation or radiation therapy. We report a 72-year-old woman with umbilical papules and vesicle-like lesions that led to the diagnosis of a large ovarian fibroma. Histologic study revealed dilated lymphatic spaces manifesting an anastomosing and branched pattern in the papillary and reticular dermis dissecting collagen bundles. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with foci of intravascular papillary endothelial cell hyperplasia. After the ovarian fibroma was removed by laparotomy, umbilical lesions almost disappeared, leaving small flesh-colored papules. A periumbilical dermatosis may herald certain intra-abdominal diseases including those of neoplastic derivation. A heightened awareness of this association may lead to an early diagnosis with a potential for improved patient outcome. Benign lymphangiomatous papules have not been previously described in association with an untreated tumor, without previous operation or radiotherapy. This case advocates for disruption of the lymphatic drainage as the probable pathogenetic mechanism.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following mechanism:

1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that induces cytotoxicity in cancer cells by forming O6-methylguanine adducts in DNA. The repair of these adducts is mediated by the enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).
2. **MGMT promoter methylation status**: The abstract "Temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to radiotherapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: correlation with MGMT promoter methylation status" suggests that the MGMT promoter methylation status is a predictive biomarker for the response to temozolomide treatment. Patients with methylated MGMT promoters tend to have better outcomes with temozolomide treatment.
3. **Methionine stress and IRF1 upregulation**: The abstract "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" describes a treatment strategy that involves reducing methionine levels to induce stress in cancer cells. This stress leads to the upregulation of various genes, including IRF1, which is involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune responses.
4. **IRF1's role in cancer cell response to temozolomide**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, IRF1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. It is possible that IRF1 upregulation in response to methionine stress could enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to temozolomide-induced DNA damage.
5. **PARP-1 inhibition and temozolomide synergy**: The abstract "PARP-1 inhibition sensitizes temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cell lines and decreases drug resistance independent of MGMT activity and PTEN proficiency" suggests that PARP-1 inhibition can enhance the efficacy of temozolomide treatment by inducing synthetic lethality in cancer cells. This synergy could be related to the upregulation of IRF1, as PARP-1 inhibition has been shown to regulate IRF1 expression in other contexts.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed as follows:

Temozolomide treatment → MGMT promoter methylation status → Methionine stress → IRF1 upregulation → Enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide-induced DNA damage → Synergy with PARP-1 inhibition → Increased efficacy of temozolomide treatment

This proposed mechanism highlights the potential for IRF1 to play a role in the response of cancer cells to temozolomide treatment, particularly in the context of methionine stress and PARP-1 inhibition. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the relationships between these entities and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting IRF1 in combination with temozolomide treatment.

MR visualization of the insula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made possible non-invasive research on the living human brain. However, three-dimensional display of areas obscured by the operculum deep within the cortex has been difficult. This study used MRI in an attempt to establish a three-dimensional method of displaying an obscured brain structure (the insula). A three-dimensional image of the insular cortex was constructed from horizontal MR images. As a result, the major anatomical landmarks of the insula were clearly displayed. This method makes possible non-invasive display and analysis of obscured structures deep in the brain, overcoming the disadvantage presented by the use of sectional images.

The mean serum AFP concentration was significantly raised in the DC group compared with that in the NDC group (P less than 0.05). In seven patients with LCD at the initial biopsy, the histologic followup showed the persistence of LCD in all cases, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three cases. In serologic HBsAg-positive cases, dysplastic cells, at variance with the surrounding liver parenchyma, were almost always negative for tissue HBsAg, and always negative for tissue hepatitis B core antigens (HBcAg). AFP was never detected in either normal or dysplastic cells. Ferritin was found in all cases, but dysplastic foci displayed a lesser amount of this protein. These serologic and immunohistochemical data strongly suggest a preneoplastic significance of LCD. The importance of monitoring cirrhotic patients with LCD and particularly those with HBV infection and/or increased AFP levels with more aggressive follow-up is also stressed.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following mechanism:

1. **Temozolomide's mechanism of action**: Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and proliferation. As mentioned in the first abstract, temozolomide is used in combination with radiotherapy to treat glioblastoma.

2. **MGMT promoter methylation status**: The effectiveness of temozolomide is influenced by the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Patients with methylated MGMT promoters tend to respond better to temozolomide treatment, as seen in the first abstract.

3. **Methionine stress and IRF1 upregulation**: The fifth abstract discusses the concept of methionine stress, which involves reducing plasma methionine levels to inhibit the growth of malignant cells. This treatment approach leads to the upregulation of IRF1, among other genes, and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents like temozolomide.

4. **IRF1's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis**: IRF1 is a transcription factor involved in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Its upregulation in response to methionine stress can contribute to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.

By connecting these elements, it can be proposed that temozolomide treatment may indirectly influence IRF1 protein expression through the following pathway:

- Temozolomide treatment leads to DNA damage and the activation of cellular stress responses.
- The stress response may involve the downregulation of methionine metabolism, leading to a state of methionine stress.
- Methionine stress, in turn, upregulates IRF1 expression, which contributes to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.
- The upregulation of IRF1 may also enhance the efficacy of temozolomide treatment by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damage.

This proposed indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein highlights the complex interplay between cellular stress responses, methionine metabolism, and the regulation of transcription factors involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship and its potential implications for cancer therapy.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and connect the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and MGMT Methylation**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat glioblastoma, and its effectiveness is influenced by the methylation status of the O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) gene. MGMT methylation leads to reduced expression of the MGMT protein, which is responsible for repairing the DNA damage caused by TMZ, thereby making the tumor more susceptible to the drug.

2. **XAF1 and Resistance to Temozolomide**: XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, is found to promote resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of XAF1 is negatively correlated with its promoter methylation status and GBM patient survival, suggesting that higher XAF1 expression (possibly due to lower promoter methylation) is associated with poorer patient outcomes.

3. **IRF1 and Methionine Stress**: The abstract on "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" mentions that methionine stress (induced by reducing plasma methionine levels) can enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, such as TMZ. This approach involves the upregulation of several genes, including IRF-1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1), which plays a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

4. **Connecting Temozolomide, XAF1, and IRF1**: While there is no direct mention of IRF1 in the context of XAF1 or temozolomide resistance in the provided abstracts, we can hypothesize an indirect relationship. Methionine stress, which upregulates IRF-1, can potentially influence the expression or activity of XAF1, given that both are involved in pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis. If IRF-1 upregulation leads to decreased XAF1 expression or activity, this could enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide, as reduced XAF1 levels would likely decrease the adaptive resistance to TMZ.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be mediated through the effects of methionine stress on IRF-1 upregulation, which in turn could influence XAF1 expression or function, ultimately affecting the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide. This proposed relationship highlights the complex interplay between different molecular pathways in determining the response to chemotherapy agents like temozolomide.

By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must connect the elements from the provided abstracts, focusing on key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and MGMT Methylation**: The first abstract discusses how epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is a surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). MGMT methylation status affects the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ. High MGMT methylation enhances genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ.

2. **XAF1 and Resistance to Temozolomide**: The same abstract introduces XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promotes resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo, suggesting its role in the development of resistance to TMZ.

3. **IRF1 Upregulation in Methionine Stress**: The abstract on "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" mentions that methionine stress (induced by reducing plasma methionine levels) can upregulate IRF-1 among other factors, leading to inhibition of cell cycle and enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy, including potentially affecting the efficacy of alkylating agents like temozolomide.

4. **Connecting the Dots**: While there's no direct mention of IRF1 in the context of temozolomide resistance or XAF1 in the provided abstracts, we can hypothesize an indirect relationship. If methionine stress can upregulate IRF-1 and enhance chemotherapy efficacy, and considering that XAF1 is involved in resistance mechanisms to temozolomide, it's plausible that IRF-1 could influence XAF1 expression or function. This influence could either be direct, through transcriptional regulation, or indirect, by affecting cellular pathways that intersect with XAF1's role in resistance.

5. **Potential Mechanism**: A potential indirect relationship could be that IRF-1, upregulated under conditions of methionine stress, could modulate the expression or activity of XAF1. If IRF-1 downregulates XAF1 or inhibits its function, this could enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to temozolomide by reducing the adaptive resistance mechanisms mediated by XAF1. Conversely, if IRF-1 upregulates XAF1, it might contribute to resistance, although this would contradict the premise that IRF-1 enhances chemotherapy efficacy.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be mediated through the modulation of XAF1 by IRF-1 under conditions of methionine stress, affecting the adaptive resistance of cancer cells to temozolomide. This relationship is speculative and based on connecting elements from different abstracts, highlighting the need for direct research into the interactions between IRF-1, XAF1, and temozolomide resistance mechanisms.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must consider the key findings and underlying mechanisms mentioned in the abstracts. Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug used to treat certain types of cancer, including glioblastoma. IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell growth.

The indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein can be inferred from the following connections:

1. **Temozolomide and MGMT**: Temozolomide works by alkylating DNA, which leads to cell death. However, the enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) can repair this damage, making cells resistant to temozolomide. The abstract "Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma" suggests that MGMT methylation status affects the response to temozolomide.

2. **MGMT and Methionine Stress**: The abstract "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" describes how methionine stress (induced by reducing plasma methionine levels) can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, including temozolomide. Methionine stress inhibits the growth of tumor cells and increases the expression of IRF1, among other genes.

3. **IRF1 and Tumor Response**: IRF1 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The upregulation of IRF1 in response to methionine stress suggests that IRF1 may play a role in the enhanced efficacy of temozolomide under these conditions.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein can be described as follows: temozolomide's efficacy is affected by MGMT methylation status, which can be influenced by methionine stress. Methionine stress, in turn, upregulates IRF1, which may contribute to the enhanced efficacy of temozolomide. This relationship is indirect because temozolomide does not directly interact with IRF1, but rather, its efficacy is influenced by a series of intermediate mechanisms involving MGMT and methionine stress.

The key intermediate entities or processes in this relationship are:

* MGMT methylation status
* Methionine stress
* IRF1 upregulation

These entities and processes connect temozolomide to IRF1, illustrating a possible indirect linkage between the two.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Evaluation of Bauhinia monandra aqueous and ethanol extracts in pregnant rats. Bauhinia monandra Kurz. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) is a plant widely employed in Brazilian folk medicine for hypoglycemia. However, little is known about the effect of maternal exposure to this plant on fetal development. The aqueous and ethanol extracts obtained from B. monandra dried leaves were administered to pregnant Wistar rats throughout gestation (day 1 to day 20) at 1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group). Maternal toxicity was not observed in the dams of both groups, and was evaluated by observing body weight, water and food intake during treatment, by measuring serum biochemical levels of creatinine, urea, AST and ALT, and by studying the histopathology of liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen and uterus at the end of treatment (gestation day 20). Both extracts and doses did not impair reproductive performance or delay fetal development, measured by observing implantations and reabsorptions in the uterus, by counting the number of corpora lutea in ovaries, by recording the litter weight and number of live and dead fetuses and by analyzing possible skeleton and viscera malformations in the fetuses. Also, the aqueous extract promoted decreased post-implantation loss when compared to the control group. The aqueous and ethanol extracts from B. monandra dried leaves (1,400 or 7,000 mg/kg/day) did not cause maternal or fetal toxicities and the aqueous extract promoted increased implantation and decreased post-implantation loss in the pregnant rats.

CYP11B2 expression in rat liver and the effect of spironolactone on hepatic fibrogenesis. In consideration of the hypothetical possibility that locally produced aldosterone is likely to take an active part in fibrogenesis of the liver, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression of aldosterone synthase gene CYP11B2 in rat liver and the curative effect of spironolactone on fibrosis of the liver. 160 Wistar rats weighing about 250 g were divided into four groups as follows: model group, spironolactone group, malotilate group and control group. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. Morphological examination was based on microscopic and electron microscopic findings. The area of collagen was examined by an Image Analyse System (Leica). By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, the expression of CYP11B2 was detected. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA, which was localized in the endoplasm of fat-storing cells, was upregulated when fibrogenesis occurred. The grade of fibrosis and the area of collagen in the spironolactone group were less than those in the model group before the 6th week (p < 0.05). After the 6th week, there was no significant difference between the spironolactone group and the model group (p > 0.05). The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is upregulated in fibrotic liver. Spironolactone can partly have a fibrogenesis-inhibiting effect in the early stage of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis.

Antitumour effect of irradiation followed by hyperglycemia and hyperthermia: the dependence on tumour size and blood flow. The interrelationship of three tumour parameters-volume, blood flow and growth delay-was evaluated after irradiation alone or combined with hyperglycemia (HG) and hyperthermia (HT). The experiments were performed on Ehrlich carcinoma tumours 5, 7 or 9 days after intramuscular implantation when they reached a mean volume of approximately 0.17, 0.46 or 0.90 cm3, respectively. Tumours were irradiated at a dose of 12.5 Gy. In groups of trimodality therapy, induction of HG (5i.p. injections of glucose during a 2-h period, total dose of glucose 10.4 g/kg) was started immediately after irradiation, and HT (water bath, 43 degrees C, 30 min) was given 3 h later. Regardless of the method of therapy, blood flow in the central part of each tumour was measured 4 and 7 h after irradiation by 133Xe clearance technique. It was shown that if tumours were treated by irradiation alone, both tumour blood flow and growth delay declined with increasing tumour volume. There was no correlation between individual values of tumour blood flow intensity and growth delay within each size group, and only all the data pooled together showed a significant direct relationship between these two parameters. In contrast, for radiotherapy with HG and HT, the antitumour effect increased with tumour volume. Blood flow was strongly inhibited by radio-modifiers; the larger tumours, the lower levels of perfusion were observed. There was a pronounced trend of increased tumour growth delay with decreased blood flow for tumours of the same volume, and these parameters were highly correlated if all individual data were analysed together regardless of tumour size. It was concluded that postirradiation blood flow inhibition plays a significant role in the tumouricidal effect of irradiation with HG and HT. The monitoring of tumour perfusion may be useful for the prediction of the effectiveness of such postirradiation modification, which is especially attractive in radiotherapy of large advanced tumours.

Reversible hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy caused by consumption of iodocasein. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of acute myocarditis and pericarditis, admitted for fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea upon exertion. Hematochemical parameters and instrumental examinations suggested iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. Although gathering information about the medication used at home was initially difficult because of the patient's refusal to cooperate, she ended up by disclosing the regular assumption of an iodocasein drug. A complete and stable regression of the clinical picture was reached by suspending the iodine derivative and using cardiovascular drugs.

Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Malignant cells fail to utilize homocysteine (HCYS) in place of methionine (MET) and they are dependent on exogenous MET for growth. In animals, reduction of plasma MET to <5 microM can be induced by combined dietary restriction of MET and administration of L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-lyase (methioninase). This treatment, termed as MET-stress, inhibits the growth of brain tumor xenografts in athymic mice and enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The response of tumors to MET-stress depends on their mutational status, however, it always involves inhibition of CDK1 and in most cases the upregulation of p21, p27, GADDs and 14-3-3sigma in response to upregulation of TGF-beta, IRF-1, TNF-alpha, Rb and/or MDA-7 and the downregulation of PI3K, RAS and NF-kappaB. Although inhibition of the cell cycle and mitosis is not necessarily dependent on the tumor's p53 status, the expression of p21, GADD45 and apoptosis related genes (BAX, BCL-2) are regulated by wt-p53, in addition to their regulation by TGF-beta or MDA-7 in mutated p53 tumors. Mutational variability determines the mode of death (mitotic catastrophe versus apoptosis) in tumor cells subjected to MET-stress. The increase of the efficacy of alkylating agents is related to marked inhibition of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression, the induction of cell cycle check points and the inhibition of pro-survival pathways by MET-stress.

CTV-to-PTV margin assessment for esophageal cancer radiotherapy based on an accumulated dose analysis. This study aimed to assess the smallest clinical target volume (CTV) to planned target volume (PTV) margins for esophageal cancer radiotherapy using daily online registration to the bony anatomy that yield full dosimetric coverage over the course of treatment. 29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved. The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction. Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match. However, two patients with extreme esophageal interfraction motion were insufficiently covered with these margins and were identified as patients requiring replanning to achieve full target coverage.

Impact of new legislation on presumed consent on organ donation on liver transplant in Singapore: a preliminary analysis. Demand for the liver organ for transplantation vastly exceeded the availability of deceased donor organs. A new law, the revised Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), was implemented in Singapore in July 2004, which allowed for recovering four organs, including liver, for transplant unless the deceased give objection prior to their demise. We set to study the impact of the revised legislation by comparing the number of potential suitable donors, liver recovery surgery, and liver transplants two years before and one year after the implementation. There was no change in the number of suitable donors, but there was an increase in the number of liver recovery surgeries and liver transplantation, and a lower refusal rate among suitable donors. Although the revised legislation helped improve the availability of deceased donor organs moderately, other nonlegislative, supplementary measures are needed to further improve the low organ donation rate.

Correlation between effects of 24 different cytochalasins on cellular structures and cellular events and those on actin in vitro. To compare the effects of cytochalasins on the cellular level with those on the molecular level, 24 cytochalasins, 20 natural compounds and 4 derivatives, were used. The following effects were tested for each of 24 cytochalasins; (a) four high dose (2-20 muM) effects on the cellular level: rounding up of fibroblastic cells, contraction of actin cables, formation of hairy filaments containing actin, and inhibition of lymphocyte capping; (b) a low dose (0.2-2 muM) effect: inhibition of membrane ruffling; and (c) two in vitro effects: an inhibition of actin filament elongation (the high affinity effect [low dose effect] in vitro) and an effect on viscosity of actin filaments(the low affinity effect [high dose effect] in vitro). These results indicated that there are almost the same hierarchic orders of relative effectiveness of different cytochalasins between low and high dose effects and between cellular and molecular effects. From the data obtained with the 24 cytochalasins, we have calculated correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.79 between an effect in vivo, inhibition of capping, and an effect in vitro, inhibition of actin filament elongation, as well as between inhibition of capping and another effect in vitro, effect on viscosity of actin filaments, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between the high affinity effect and the low affinity effect determined in vitro was calculated to be 0.90 from the data obtained in this study. The strong positive correlation among low and high dose effects in vivo and those in vitro suggests that most of the effects caused by a cytochalasin, irrespective of doses or affected phenomena, might be attributed to the interaction between the drug and the common target protein, actin. In the course of the immunofluorescence microscope study on cytochalasin-treated cells using actin antibody, we have found that aspochalasin D, a 10-isopropylcytochalasin, strongly induced the formation of rodlets containing actin in the cytoplasm of the treated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other cytochalasins, including cytochalasin B, cytochalasin C, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin H, were found to induce the formation of nuclear rodlets. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear rodlets found in the cytochalasin-treated cells were similar in ultrastructures to those induced by 5 to 10 percent (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide in the same type of cells.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and MGMT Methylation**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat glioblastoma, and its efficacy is influenced by the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. MGMT methylation leads to decreased MGMT expression, which in turn increases the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ. However, the adaptive resistance mechanisms that glioblastoma cells develop over time can reduce the effectiveness of TMZ.

2. **IRF1 and Methionine Stress**: The abstract on "Methionine-stress: a pleiotropic approach in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy" mentions that methionine stress can enhance the efficacy of DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, such as TMZ, by inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. This process involves the upregulation of IRF-1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1), among other factors. IRF-1 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The upregulation of IRF-1 in response to methionine stress suggests a potential link between IRF-1 and the enhanced efficacy of TMZ.

3. **Connecting Temozolomide and IRF1**: While there is no direct mention of a relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred through the context of methionine stress and its effects on tumor cells. Methionine stress can make tumor cells more susceptible to the effects of TMZ by modulating various cellular pathways, including those involving IRF-1. Therefore, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be mediated by the effects of methionine stress on tumor cells, which enhances the efficacy of TMZ through the upregulation of IRF-1 and other factors.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is based on the concept that methionine stress can enhance the efficacy of TMZ by upregulating IRF-1 and modulating other cellular pathways involved in tumor cell growth and survival. This relationship highlights the potential for targeting methionine metabolism as a strategy to improve the effectiveness of TMZ in cancer therapy.

Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery.

The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a proapoptotic tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Skeletal muscle myosin monomer in equilibrium with filaments forms a folded conformation. Rabbit skeletal myosin forms stable filaments under physiological conditions, and only a small amount stays as a monomer in equilibrium with filaments. The myosin monomers were observed in two conformational states, as extended and folded forms upon electron microscopy and gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography. The fraction of monomers in the folded conformation increased with a decrease in the concentration of NaCl below 0.2 M, and the conformational state was affected neither by the presence of ATP nor by the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain. In most of the folded monomers, the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, 45 nm apart from the head-tail junction, and the remaining tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction. Only a small percentage of the folded monomers was in a more compact conformation close to the 10 S conformation of vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins. The folded monomers, however, may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis as assessed by single turnover experiments. The percentage of monomers in the 10 S-like conformation was increased by the exchange of a regulatory light chain with the smooth muscle light chain, indicating the participation of head-tail junction, including the regulatory light chain in the formation of folded conformation. The folded conformation may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed as follows:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma. It is found that XAF1 promotes resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo.

2. **XAF1 and IRF1 interaction**: The fifth abstract reveals that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF1 to drive apoptotic stress response and suppress tumorigenesis. XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF1. This interaction enhances stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells.

3. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Considering the findings from the first and fifth abstracts, it can be inferred that temozolomide treatment may influence the expression or activity of XAF1, which in turn affects the IRF1 protein. If XAF1 is upregulated or activated in response to temozolomide, it could lead to the stabilization and activation of IRF1, potentially enhancing the apoptotic stress response and suppressing tumorigenesis.

4. **Intermediate entities or processes**: The second abstract mentions that XAF1 promoter methylation is associated with IDH1 mutations in high-grade gliomas. This suggests that epigenetic modifications, such as promoter methylation, may play a role in regulating XAF1 expression and, subsequently, IRF1 activity.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, may involve the following sequence of events:

Temozolomide treatment → XAF1 upregulation/activation → IRF1 stabilization/activation → Enhanced apoptotic stress response and tumorigenesis suppression

This proposed relationship highlights the potential interplay between temozolomide, XAF1, and IRF1 in the context of glioblastoma and suggests that further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

If XAF1 is downregulated or epigenetically silenced in response to temozolomide, this could disrupt the positive feedback loop between XAF1 and IRF1, potentially leading to reduced IRF1 activity. Conversely, if XAF1 is upregulated, it may enhance IRF1 activity, contributing to increased apoptotic stress response and suppression of tumorigenesis.

4. **Intermediate entities or processes**: The second abstract mentions that XAF1 promoter methylation is associated with IDH1 mutations in high-grade gliomas. This suggests that IDH1 mutations may be an intermediate factor influencing the relationship between temozolomide and IRF1, potentially through effects on XAF1 expression or epigenetic regulation.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, may involve the following sequence of events:

Temozolomide treatment → affects XAF1 expression or epigenetic regulation → influences the XAF1-IRF1 positive feedback loop → impacts IRF1 activity and apoptotic stress response → contributes to tumorigenesis or tumor suppression.

This proposed relationship highlights the complexity of the underlying mechanisms and the potential involvement of intermediate entities, such as IDH1 mutations, in modulating the effects of temozolomide on IRF1 protein activity.

Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1-XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1-XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.

Excimer retreatment of regression after photorefractive keratectomy. Regression of effect is a well-established complication of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of myopia. In 17 eyes retreated with excimer photorefractive keratectomy, minimum follow-up time was six months. Mean (+/- SD) refraction at six months postoperatively was -0.97 +/- 2.10 diopters, significantly different (P < .01) from the pre-retreatment mean of -2.91 +/- 0.86 diopters. The 11 best eyes (six-month refraction < -1.00 diopter) had a mean refraction of +0.32 +/- 0.67 diopter. At six months after retreatment, 64.7% had an uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40, and 58.8% were within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. Two eyes showed a loss of one to two Snellen lines at six months. There was no significant increase in mean haze after retreatment. While the percentage of eyes with uncorrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/40 and the percentage of eyes within 1.00 diopter of emmetropia were lower than in eyes which did not require retreatment, the results of this study indicate that the majority of photorefractive keratectomy regressions can be successfully retreated.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following mechanism:

1. **Temozolomide resistance and XAF1**: The first abstract mentions that XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically mediates differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma cells. XAF1 promotes resistance to TMZ both in vitro and in vivo.
2. **XAF1 and IRF1 interaction**: The fifth abstract reveals that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF1, where XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF1. This interaction enhances stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells.
3. **IRF1 and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)**: The fourth abstract shows that hyper-activated IRF1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced ISG expression, including XAF1, in response to interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells.
4. **Temozolomide and epigenetic regulation**: The first abstract mentions that epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is a surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide. MGMT methylation status affects the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ.
5. **XAF1 methylation and IDH1 mutations**: The second abstract indicates that XAF1 promoter methylation is strongly associated with IDH1 mutations in high-grade gliomas. IDH1 mutations can influence the epigenetic landscape and potentially affect the expression of genes involved in temozolomide resistance.

By connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed:

Temozolomide treatment may lead to the activation of XAF1, which in turn interacts with IRF1, enhancing its activity and promoting a stress-induced apoptotic response. However, if XAF1 is epigenetically silenced through promoter methylation, which is associated with IDH1 mutations, the XAF1-IRF1 feedback loop may be disrupted, leading to reduced IRF1 activity and potentially contributing to temozolomide resistance. Additionally, the epigenetic regulation of MGMT and other genes involved in temozolomide resistance may also influence the activity of IRF1 and its downstream targets, including XAF1.

This proposed mechanism highlights the complex interplay between temozolomide, XAF1, IRF1, and epigenetic regulation in glioblastoma cells, and suggests that the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, may be influenced by multiple factors, including XAF1 expression, IDH1 mutations, and epigenetic modifications.

Paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 mediates plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Epigenetic regulation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is surrogate of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). However, mechanisms associated with adaptive resistance evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) relative to MGMT methylation remain unclear. We hereby report a paradoxical yet translational epigenetic regulation of plasticity towards adaptive resistance in GBM. Based on an adaptive resistance model of GBM cells with differential MGMT methylation profiles, MGMT-hypermethylation enhanced genetic and phenotypic plasticity towards adaptive resistance to TMZ while MGMT hypomethylation limited plasticity. The resulting model-associated adaptive resistance gene signature negatively correlated with GBM patient survival. XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, paradoxically emerged as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ through epigenetic regulation. XAF1 promoted resistance both in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, XAF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 promoter methylation status, and negatively correlate with GBM patient survival. Collectively, XAF1 appears to have a pradoxical yet translational role in GBM.

Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a tumor suppressor that counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of XIAP and can sensitize cells to cell death triggering events. XAF1 knockdown abrogated the temozolomide (TMZ)-induced G2-arrest and prevented TMZ-induced apoptosis in the glioblastoma (GB) cell line LN229. Promoter methylation of XAF1 was found to be inversely correlated with mRNA expression in GB cells. We analyzed XAF1 methylation in a panel of 16 GB cell lines and 80 patients with first-diagnosed WHO grade III/IV high-grade gliomas using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. In those patients, XAF1 promoter methylation was strongly associated with enhanced progression free and overall survival. Interestingly, XAF1 promoter methylation was strictly correlated with the occurrence of IDH1 mutations, indicating a causal link to the IDH1 mutant phenotype. XAF1 methylation was observed in 18 grade III tumors all of which showed heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 gene. 17 harbored a mutation leading to an arginine > histidine (R132H) and one carried a mutation causing an arginine > glycine (R132G) substitution. Furthermore, six out of six recurrent and IDH1 mutated grade III tumors also showed XAF1 promoter methylation. The data demonstrate that XAF1 promoter methylation determined by MS-HRM is a robust and precise indicator of IDH1 mutations in grade III gliomas. It is useful for complementing the immunohistochemistry-based detection of mutant IDH, uncovering rare 2-HG-producing IDH1 and potentially IDH2 mutations. The MS-HRM-based detection of XAF1 methylation could therefore be a reliable tool in assisting the sub-classification of high-grade gliomas.

Immunohistochemical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human fetal airway and digestive mucosa. The cellular distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human fetal digestive and respiratory mucosa has been studied by immunohistochemistry. The streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was applied to paraffin-embedded specimens collected from normal fetuses ranging from 7 to 39 wk of gestation. By the 7th wk, CFTR protein was strongly detected in the yolk sack; in contrast, the staining was weak in the undifferentiated epithelium of the intestine and the airways. At 12 wk, the intestine showed strongly and diffusely stained enterocytes and a basal cytoplasmic reactivity in the first secretory cells. During development, only slight changes could be detected in the digestive epithelial distribution of CFTR. In the airways, the CFTR distribution followed the cephalocaudal maturation. In the tracheal ciliated cells, the CFTR protein was diffusely detected in the cytoplasm as early as 7 wk. After 24-25 wk, CFTR was localized at the apical domain of the ciliated cells and was also present in the collecting ducts and in the glands of the airways, predominantly in the periphery of the acini. Our data suggest that the CFTR is present as early as 7 wk during organogenesis and probably plays an important role during fetal life. There is an evolution in the CFTR distribution during airway development, whereas, in the intestine, CFTR is highly expressed through the epithelium as early as 12 wk and keeps the same distribution until birth.

A feasibility study to determine the benefits of upper extremity virtual rehabilitation therapy for coping with chronic pain post-cancer surgery. Persistent pain in shoulder and arm following post-surgical breast cancer treatment can lead to cognitive and physical deficits. Depression is also common in breast cancer survivors. Virtual reality therapy with integrative cognitive and physical rehabilitation has not been clinically trialed for this population. The novel BrightArm Duo technology improved cognition and upper extremity (UE) function for other diagnoses and has great potential to benefit individuals coping with post-surgical breast cancer pain. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of BrightArm Duo therapy for coping with post-surgical chronic pain and associated disability in breast cancer survivors with depression. BrightArm Duo is a robotic rehabilitation table modulating gravity loading on supported forearms. It tracks arm position and grasping strength while patients play three-dimensional (3D) custom integrative rehabilitation games. Community-dwelling women (N = 6) with post-surgical breast cancer pain in the upper arm trained on the system twice a week for 8 weeks. Training difficulty increased progressively in game complexity, table tilt and session length (20-50 minutes). Standardized assessments were performed before and after therapy for pain, cognition, emotion, UE function and activities of daily living. Subjects averaged upwards of 1300 arm repetitions and 850 hand grasps per session. Pain intensity showed a 20% downward trend (p = 0.1) that was corroborated by therapist observations and participant feedback. A total of 10 out of 11 cognitive metrics improved post-training (p = 0.01) with a significant 8.3-point reduction in depression severity (p = 0.04). A total of 17 of 18 range of motion metrics increased (p < 0.01), with five affected-side shoulder improvements above the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (8 degrees ). In all, 13 out of 15 strength and function metrics improved (p = 0.02) with lateral deltoid strength increasing 7.4 N on the affected side (p = 0.05). This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of using the BrightArm Duo Rehabilitation System to treat cancer survivors coping with upper body chronic pain. Outcomes indicate improvement in cognition, shoulder range, strength, function and depression.

Hyper-activated IRF-1 and STAT1 contribute to enhanced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression by interferon alpha and gamma co-treatment in human hepatoma cells. Previous reports suggest that type I and type II Interferon can co-operatively inhibit some virus replication, e.g. HCV, SARS-CoV, HSV-1. To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-alpha and gamma were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must connect the elements presented in the abstracts, focusing on key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes. The connection involves several steps and entities, including XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein, and the role of interferons in gene expression.

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and XAF1**: The first abstract discusses the paradoxical epigenetic regulation of XAF1 in mediating plasticity towards adaptive resistance evolution in MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat glioblastoma, and resistance to TMZ is a significant challenge. XAF1 emerges as a mediator of differential plasticities towards adaptive resistance to TMZ. This means that XAF1 plays a role in how glioblastoma cells develop resistance to temozolomide.

2. **XAF1 and Its Role**: The second abstract further explores XAF1, stating that it is a tumor suppressor that counteracts anti-apoptotic effects and can sensitize cells to cell death. The methylation status of XAF1's promoter is inversely correlated with its mRNA expression, and this methylation is associated with improved clinical outcomes in high-grade gliomas. This suggests that XAF1's activity is crucial in the context of glioblastoma and its treatment.

3. **IRF1 and Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs)**: The fifth abstract introduces IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) and its role in enhancing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when interferon alpha and gamma are co-administered. Among the ISGs whose transcription is enhanced is XAF1. This indicates that IRF1 can influence the expression of XAF1 through its role in the interferon signaling pathway.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: Connecting these elements, we can propose an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human. Temozolomide treatment can lead to the development of resistance in glioblastoma cells, a process in which XAF1 is involved. IRF1, through its role in the interferon signaling pathway, can influence the expression of XAF1. Therefore, IRF1 could indirectly affect the sensitivity or resistance of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide by regulating XAF1 expression. This relationship suggests that the activity of IRF1, influenced by interferon signaling, could impact the effectiveness of temozolomide treatment by modulating the levels or activity of XAF1, a protein involved in resistance mechanisms.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is mediated through XAF1, a tumor suppressor protein whose expression can be influenced by IRF1 in the context of interferon signaling. This relationship highlights the complex interplay between signaling pathways, gene expression, and drug resistance in cancer treatment.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Alcohol expectancies longitudinally predict drinking and the alcohol myopia effects of relief, self-inflation, and excess. Alcohol myopia theory posits that alcohol consumption attenuates information processing capacity, and that expectancy beliefs together with intake level are responsible for experiences in myopic effects (relief, self-inflation, and excess). Adults (N=413) averaging 36.39 (SD=13.02) years of age completed the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire at baseline, followed by alcohol use measures (frequency and quantity) and the Alcohol Myopia Scale one month later. Three structural equation models based on differing construct manifestations of alcohol expectancies served to longitudinally forecast alcohol use and myopia. In Model 1, overall expectancy predicted greater alcohol use and higher levels of all three myopic effects. In Model 2, specifying separate positive and negative expectancy factors, positive but not negative expectancy predicted greater use. Furthermore, positive expectancy and use explained higher myopic relief and higher self-inflation, whereas positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and use explained higher myopic excess. In Model 3, the seven specific expectancy subscales (sociability, tension reduction, liquid courage, sexuality, cognitive and behavioral impairment, risk and aggression, and self-perception) were simultaneously specified as predictors. Tension reduction expectancy, sexuality expectancy, and use contributed to higher myopic relief; sexuality expectancy and use explained higher myopic self-inflation; and risk and aggression expectancy and use accounted for higher myopic excess. Across all three predictive models, the total variance explained ranged from 12 to 19% for alcohol use, 50 to 51% for relief, 29 to 34% for self-inflation, and 32 to 35% for excess. Findings support that the type of alcohol myopia experienced is a concurrent function of self-fulfilling alcohol prophecies and drinking levels. The interpreted measurement manifestation of expectancy yielded different prevention implications.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must connect the elements from the provided abstracts. The key findings and underlying mechanisms suggest the following narrative:

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and TROY Signaling**: Temozolomide is a standard chemotherapy drug used to treat glioblastoma. However, resistance to temozolomide is a significant challenge. The TROY signaling pathway, which interacts with JAK1-STAT3, has been identified as a factor that promotes glioblastoma cell migration and resistance to temozolomide. Inhibiting JAK1 activity using ruxolitinib can reduce TROY-induced STAT3 activation and decrease resistance to temozolomide.

2. **Ruxolitinib and Its Effects**: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, has been shown to interact with other drugs, such as dimethyl fumarate (DMF), to kill tumor cells, including those resistant to standard therapies like temozolomide. The combination of ruxolitinib and DMF can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to tumor cell death.

3. **IRF1 and Its Regulation**: IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses and can be induced by interferons. In the context of cancer, IRF1 has been implicated in the regulation of PD-L1 expression, a protein that helps cancer cells evade the immune system. The expression of IRF1 can be regulated by various signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT pathway.

4. **Connection between Temozolomide, JAK/STAT, and IRF1**: While there is no direct link between temozolomide and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred. Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells can be mediated by the TROY signaling pathway, which activates the JAK1-STAT3 pathway. The JAK/STAT pathway can, in turn, regulate the expression of IRF1, which is involved in the regulation of PD-L1. Therefore, inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway using ruxolitinib could potentially reduce IRF1 expression and subsequently affect PD-L1 levels, influencing the tumor's ability to evade the immune system.

5. **Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) and IRF1**: Another abstract mentions that EGCG, a component of green tea, can inhibit the IFN-γ pathway and reduce the expression of IRF1, leading to decreased PD-L1 expression. This suggests that EGCG could be used to modulate IRF1 expression and potentially enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, involves the following steps:

- Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells is mediated by the TROY signaling pathway, which activates the JAK1-STAT3 pathway.
- The JAK/STAT pathway regulates IRF1 expression, which is involved in PD-L1 regulation.
- Inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway using ruxolitinib or other agents could reduce IRF1 expression and subsequently affect PD-L1 levels, influencing the tumor's ability to evade the immune system.

This narrative connects the key findings and underlying mechanisms from the provided abstracts, illustrating a possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote glioblastoma cell migration and resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and carries a discouraging prognosis. Its aggressive and highly infiltrative nature renders the current standard treatment of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy relatively ineffective. Identifying the signaling pathways that regulate GBM migration/invasion and resistance is required to develop more effective therapeutic regimens to treat GBM. Expression of TROY, an orphan receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily, increases with glial tumor grade, inversely correlates with patient overall survival, stimulates GBM cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in a preclinical intracranial xenograft model. Here, we have identified for the first time that TROY interacts with JAK1. Increased TROY expression increases JAK1 phosphorylation. In addition, increased TROY expression promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 transcriptional activity that is dependent upon JAK1. TROY-mediated activation of STAT3 is independent of its ability to stimulate activity of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of JAK1 activity by ruxolitinib or knockdown of JAK1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibits TROY-induced STAT3 activation, GBM cell migration, and decreases resistance to temozolomide. Taken together, our data indicate that the TROY signaling complex may represent a potential therapeutic target with the distinctive capacity to exert effects on multiple pathways mediating GBM cell invasion and resistance.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Antihypertensive medication withholding practices in hemodialysis: A survey study of patients and providers.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed as follows:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract mentions that TROY, an orphan receptor, increases resistance to temozolomide in glioblastoma cells. TROY signals through JAK1-STAT3 to promote cell migration and resistance.
2. **JAK1-STAT3 signaling**: The second abstract shows that ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, can interact with dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells, including glioblastoma cells. Ruxolitinib inhibits STAT3 activation, which is downstream of JAK1.
3. **IRF1 regulation by STAT1**: The fifth abstract reveals that EGF induces STAT1 expression, which in turn regulates IRF1, a transcription factor involved in the PD-L1 axis. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib decreases STAT1 and IRF1 levels.
4. **IRF1 inhibition by EGCG**: The sixth abstract demonstrates that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation, leading to the downregulation of IRF1 expression. This results in the inhibition of HLA-DR and HLA-B expression.

Connecting these elements, we can propose an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human:

Temozolomide → TROY (increased resistance) → JAK1-STAT3 signaling (promoting resistance) → STAT1 activation (regulated by EGF) → IRF1 expression (regulated by STAT1)

In this narrative, temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells is mediated by TROY, which activates JAK1-STAT3 signaling. This signaling pathway can be inhibited by ruxolitinib, which in turn affects STAT1 activation. STAT1 regulates IRF1 expression, which is involved in the PD-L1 axis. EGCG can inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation, leading to the downregulation of IRF1 expression.

While this relationship is indirect and involves multiple intermediate entities and processes, it highlights the complex interplay between signaling pathways and transcription factors in cancer cells. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting IRF1 and related pathways in glioblastoma.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

Our understanding of the neural basis of locomotor behavior can be informed by careful quantification of animal movement.  Classical descriptions of legged locomotion have defined discrete locomotor gaits, characterized by distinct patterns of limb movement.  Recent technical advances have enabled increasingly detailed characterization of limb kinematics across many species, imposing tighter constraints on neural control.  Here, we highlight striking similarities between coordination patterns observed in two genetic model organisms: the laboratory mouse and Drosophila.  Both species exhibit continuously-variable coordination patterns with similar low-dimensional structure, suggesting shared principles for limb coordination and descending neural control. 

Reversible Hydration Composite Films for Evaporative Perspiration Control and Heat Stress Management.  Donning of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare sector has been intensified by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  While extensive PPE provides protection, it typically limits moisture permeability and severely hinders the sweat evaporation process, resulting in greater heat stress on the personnel.  Herein, a zinc-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Zn-PVA) composite film is fabricated by embedding a super-hygroscopic zinc-ethanolamine complex (Zn-complex) in the PVA matrix.  By attaching the Zn-PVA composite film, the relative humidity (RH) inside the protective suit decreases from 91.0% to 48.2%.  The reduced RH level, in turn, enhances evaporative cooling, hence bringing down the heat index from 64.6 to 40.0  degrees C at an air temperature of 35  degrees C, remarkably lowering the likelihood of heat stroke.  The American Society for Testing and Materials tests conducted on a sweating manikin have also proven that the Zn-PVA composite films can significantly reduce the evaporative resistance of the protective suit by 90%.  The low material cost, facile fabrication process, and reusability allow the Zn-PVA composition films to be readily available for healthcare workers worldwide.  This application can be further extended to other occupations that are facing severe thermal discomfort and heat stress. 

Influence of freezing and heating conditions on grape seed flavan-3-ol extractability, oxidation, and galloylation pattern.  In cool-climate viticulture, the short growing season can influence grape seed maturation by reducing the apparent oxidation of flavan-3-ol monomers and associated increase in seed browning.  A reduction in seed maturation increases the potential extraction of flavan-3-ol monomers into wine during maceration operations, heightening bitterness.  Here, we carried out a 2 * 2 factorial experiment to test the ability of freezing and heating treatments to advance maturation (decrease flavan-3-ol, improve browning) of (Vitis vinifera L.)  Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon seeds over a 24-h incubation period.  Only freezing significantly increased seed browning in both cultivars.  Subsequent correlations with seed flavan-3-ol monomer concentrations suggest that freezing enhanced the oxidation of these compounds.  Interestingly, natural ripening and freezing reduced galloylated flavan-3-ol monomers to a greater extent than non-galloylated ones.  This study provides new information regarding the susceptibility of flavan-3-ol monomers to freezing and heating, and also suggests that freezing can advance the maturation the seeds of under-ripe red vinifera grapes.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must connect the elements mentioned in the abstracts to form a coherent narrative. The key findings and underlying mechanisms from the abstracts can be linked as follows:

1. **Temozolomide Resistance and TROY Signaling**: The first abstract discusses how TROY signaling through JAK1-STAT3 promotes glioblastoma cell migration and resistance to temozolomide. This indicates that temozolomide's effectiveness can be influenced by signaling pathways involving JAK1 and STAT3.

2. **JAK1 Inhibition and IRF1**: The fifth abstract mentions that the blockade of EGFR by afatinib results in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels. This suggests a connection between JAK1/STAT signaling and IRF-1 expression. Since IRF-1 is a transcription factor involved in interferon signaling and can influence various cellular processes including immune responses and cell growth, its downregulation could impact the cellular response to temozolomide.

3. **Ruxolitinib's Role**: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is mentioned in several abstracts. It inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation, which is crucial for the IFNγ-mediated PD-L1 axis. Given that PD-L1 expression can influence tumor immune evasion, the inhibition of this axis could potentially enhance the effectiveness of temozolomide by modifying the tumor microenvironment.

4. **IRF1 and Immune Response**: IRF1 plays a role in regulating immune responses, including the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules like HLA-DR and HLA-B, as mentioned in the sixth abstract. The inhibition of IRF-1 could therefore impact the immune recognition of tumor cells, potentially affecting how tumors respond to treatments like temozolomide.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could exist through the following pathway:

- Temozolomide's efficacy is influenced by the tumor's resistance mechanisms, which can involve signaling pathways like JAK1-STAT3.
- The JAK1-STAT pathway can influence IRF-1 expression, potentially through the action of inhibitors like ruxolitinib on STAT1 phosphorylation.
- IRF-1, in turn, plays a role in immune response regulation, including the expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation (e.g., HLA-DR and HLA-B).
- The modulation of IRF-1 expression or activity could therefore impact the tumor microenvironment, affecting how tumors respond to temozolomide, either by altering immune recognition or by modifying intrinsic cellular resistance mechanisms.

This narrative illustrates how temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could be indirectly related through signaling pathways and immune response mechanisms, highlighting the complexity of interactions in the tumor microenvironment and the potential for targeting these pathways to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

2025-01-20 13:30:51,750 - Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist.

Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Ruxolitinib synergizes with DMF to kill via BIM+BAD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and via reduced SOD2/TRX expression and ROS. We determined whether the myelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1/2 (JAK1 and JAK2), could interact with the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) to kill tumor cells; studies used the in vivo active form of the drug, mono-methyl fumarate (MMF). Ruxolitinib interacted with MMF to kill brain, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells, and enhanced the lethality of standard of care therapies such as paclitaxel and temozolomide. MMF also interacted with other FDA approved drugs to kill tumor cells including Celebrex(r) and Gilenya(r). The combination of [ruxolitinib + MMF] inactivated ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5; reduced expression of MCL-1, BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX; increased BIM expression; decreased BAD S112 S136 phosphorylation; and enhanced pro-caspase 3 cleavage. Expression of activated forms of STAT3, MEK1 or AKT each significantly reduced drug combination lethality; prevented BAD S112 S136 dephosphorylation and decreased BIM expression; and preserved TRX, SOD2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression. The drug combination increased the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells, and over-expression of TRX or SOD2 prevented drug combination tumor cell killing. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of BAX, BIM, BAD or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protected tumor cells. The drug combination increased AIF : HSP70 co-localization in the cytosol but this event did not prevent AIF : eIF3A association in the nucleus.

Three-dimensional organoid culture unveils resistance to clinical therapies in adult and pediatric glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. The inherent cellular diversity and interactions within tumor microenvironments represent significant challenges to effective treatment. Traditional culture methods such as adherent or sphere cultures may mask such complexities whereas three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems derived from patient cancer stem cells (CSCs) can preserve cellular complexity and microenvironments. The objective of this study was to determine if GBM organoids may offer a platform, complimentary to traditional sphere culture methods, to recapitulate patterns of clinical drug resistance arising from 3D growth. Adult and pediatric surgical specimens were collected and established as organoids. We created organoid microarrays and visualized bulk and spatial differences in cell proliferation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry paired with 3D regional labeling. We tested the response of CSCs grown in each culture method to temozolomide, ibrutinib, lomustine, ruxolitinib, and radiotherapy. GBM organoids showed diverse and spatially distinct proliferative cell niches and include heterogeneous populations of CSCs/non-CSCs (marked by SOX2) and cycling/senescent cells. Organoid cultures display a comparatively blunted response to current standard-of-care therapy (combination temozolomide and radiotherapy) that reflects what is seen in practice. Treatment of organoids with clinically relevant drugs showed general therapeutic resistance with drug- and patient-specific antiproliferative, apoptotic, and senescent effects, differing from those of matched sphere cultures. Therapeutic resistance in organoids appears to be driven by altered biological mechanisms rather than physical limitations of therapeutic access. GBM organoids may therefore offer a key technological approach to discover and understand resistance mechanisms of human cancer cells.

Mechanistic insights into the enhancement of adeno-associated virus transduction by proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, MG132) are known to enhance adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction; however, whether this results from pleotropic proteasome inhibition or off-target serine and/or cysteine protease inhibition remains unresolved. Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction.

Heterochrony repolarized: a phylogenetic analysis of developmental timing in plethodontid salamanders. Disentangling evolutionary shifts in developmental timing (heterochony) is dependent upon accurate estimates of ancestral patterns. However, many classic assessments of heterochronic patterns predate robust phylogenetic hypotheses and methods for trait reconstruction, and therefore may have been polarized with untested 'primitive' conditions. Here we revisit the heterochronic modes of development that underlie the evolution of metamorphosis, maturation, and paedomorphosis in plethodontid salamanders. We focus on the tribe Spelerpini, which is a diverse clade that exhibits tremendous variation in timing of metamorphosis and maturation, as well as multiple independent instances of larval form paedomorphosis. Based on morphology and biogeography, early investigators concluded that the most recent common ancestors of plethodontids, and also spelerpines, were large salamanders, with very long larval periods and late maturation times. This prevailing assumption influenced subsequent heterochronic assessments, which concluded that most modern spelerpines (with shorter larval periods) were derived through multiple independent accelerations in larval development. It was also concluded that most occurrences of larval form paedomorphosis in this clade resulted from progenesis (acceleration of gonadal development relative to metamorphosis). By reconstructing the time to metamorphosis on a molecular-based phylogeny of plethodontids, we find that ancestral spelerpines likely had relatively shorter larval periods than previously proposed. Taken together with the credibility interval from our ancestral state estimation we show that very long larval periods are likely derived decelerations, only a few lineages have undergone appreciable accelerations in metamorphic timing, and the remaining taxa have lower probabilities of being different than the ancestral condition (possibly due to stasis). Reconstructing maturation age across nodes concomitant with the evolution of larval form paedomorphosis in one large radiation does not show clear evidence of progenesis, but more likely indicates a case of neoteny (delayed metamorphosis). This study demonstrates cases in plethodontid salamanders where phylogenetic-based character reconstructions reject previously hypothesized ancestral life history conditions. As a result, several prior hypotheses of heterochronic evolution in this family are reversed.

An Investigation of Calibration Phantoms for CT Scanners with Tube Voltage Modulation. The effects of calibration phantoms on the correction results of the empirical artifacts correction method (ECCU) for the case of tube modulation were investigated. To improve the validity of the ECCU method, the effect of the geometry parameter of a typical single-material calibration phantom (water calibration phantom) on the ECCU algorithm was investigated. Dual-material calibration phantoms (such as water-bone calibration phantom), geometry arrangement, and the area-ratio of dual-material calibration phantoms were also studied. Preliminary results implied that, to assure the effectiveness of the ECCU algorithm, the polychromatic projections of calibration phantoms must cover the polychromatic projection data of the scanning object. However, the projection range of a water calibration phantom is limited by the scan field of view (SFOV), thus leading to methodological limitations. A dual-material phantom of a proper size and material can overcome the limitations of a single-material phantom and achieve good correction effects.

Epidermal growth factor induces STAT1 expression to exacerbate the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in many cancers, including lung and head and neck cancers, and is involved in cancer cell progression and survival. PD-L1, increases in tumor cells to evade and inhibit CD8+ T cells, is a clinical immunotherapeutic target. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of EGF on regulating PD-L1 in EGFR-positive cancers and determined potential agents to reduce PD-L1 expression. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to determine potential driver genes that regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells-derived tumorspheres which mimicking cancer stem cells. Then, the specific inhibitors targeting EGFR were applied to reduce the expression of PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. We validated that EGF could induce PD-L1 expression in the selected EGFR-positive cancers. RNAseq results revealed that STAT1 increased as a driver gene in KOSC-3-derived tumorspheres; these data were analyzed using PANTHER followed by NetworkAnalyst. The blockade of EGFR by afatinib resulted in decreased STAT1 and IRF-1 levels, both are transcriptional factors of PD-L1, and disabled the IFNr-STAT1-mediated PD-L1 axis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT1 knockdown significantly reduced EGF-mediated PD-L1 expression, and ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation to reduce the IFNr-mediated PD-L1 axis. These results indicate that EGF exacerbates PD-L1 by increasing the protein levels of STAT1 to enforce the IFNr-JAK1/2-mediated signaling axis in selected EGFR-positive cancers. The inhibition of EGFR by afatinib significantly reduced PD-L1 and may be a potential strategy for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy.

Epigallocatechin-3 Gallate Inhibits STAT-1/JAK2/IRF-1/HLA-DR/HLA-B and Reduces CD8 MKG2D Lymphocytes of Alopecia Areata Patients. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 (IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-gamma pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively. distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 mum EGCG for 48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model using PBMCs of AA patients. Interestingly, 40 mum EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 mum EGCG for 48 h. These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-gamma pathway to maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.

To describe an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, we must connect the elements from the provided abstracts. The key findings and mechanisms from the relevant abstracts can be linked as follows:

1. **Temozolomide and Cancer Treatment**: Temozolomide is a drug used in cancer treatment, particularly for brain tumors like glioblastoma. It works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and causing cell death.

2. **Ruxolitinib and Its Effects**: Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that has been shown to synergize with other drugs, including dimethyl fumarate (DMF), to kill cancer cells. This combination can lead to the inactivation of various signaling pathways (e.g., ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3, and STAT5) that are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation.

3. **STAT1 and IRF1 Connection**: The abstracts mention that EGF (epidermal growth factor) can induce STAT1 expression, which in turn can exacerbate the IFNγ-mediated PD-L1 axis in EGFR-positive cancers. IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is known to be involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression, often in conjunction with STAT1. The blockade of EGFR or the inhibition of JAK1/2 (using ruxolitinib) can decrease STAT1 and IRF1 levels, thereby reducing PD-L1 expression.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: Given that temozolomide can enhance the lethality of combinations including ruxolitinib (as seen in the first abstract), and considering ruxolitinib's role in inhibiting JAK1/2, which in turn can affect STAT1 and IRF1 expression (as indicated in the fifth abstract), an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed. Temozolomide, by enhancing the effects of ruxolitinib in killing cancer cells, could indirectly influence the expression or activity of IRF1 by modulating the signaling pathways that ruxolitinib affects, such as the JAK/STAT pathway.

5. **Mechanism**: The mechanism could involve temozolomide increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to the effects of ruxolitinib, leading to enhanced inhibition of JAK1/2. This inhibition reduces STAT1 phosphorylation and expression, which in turn could decrease IRF1 expression or activity, given their interconnected roles in the IFNγ signaling pathway and the regulation of PD-L1.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, is based on temozolomide's ability to enhance the lethality of drug combinations that include JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib's inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway can lead to decreased expression or activity of IRF1, thereby establishing an indirect link between temozolomide treatment and IRF1 modulation in cancer cells.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially "drugable" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Couples-based interventions following prostate cancer treatment: a narrative review. Sexual dysfunction following prostate cancer (PC) treatment often results in sexual avoidance and a loss of sexual intimacy, which can lead to relationship distress. This review aims to evaluate six studies intended to address relational and sexual intimacy following PC treatment and discuss methodological concerns which may help produce more effective interventions. Electronic databases used to conduct literature searches included Medline, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using samples of men diagnosed with PC of any stage, had a psychosocial intervention, and addressed at least one sexual and relational outcome. As a whole, the literature has produced mixed results. While significant findings were reported, many of the primary hypotheses were not achieved. The six studies show that men with PC may benefit from education and support related to treatment options for erectile dysfunction (ED), whereas their partners may benefit more from interventions focused on relational issues. Important methodological limitations included: selection of general outcome measures as opposed to measures specific to sexuality or intimacy outcomes, lack of assessing distress or bother of the patient/couples as study entry criteria, heterogeneity of study populations, and lack of innovative intervention content as the current studies tested standard educational interventions, sex therapies techniques, and couples therapy strategies with only marginal success. Interventions based on innovative theoretical approaches as well as study designs that address the outlined methodological limitations are needed in this area.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Developmental dyslexia: research methods and inferences.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Relaxin's induction of metalloproteinases is associated with the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in synovial joint fibrocartilaginous explants. Diseases of specific fibrocartilaginous joints are especially common in women of reproductive age, suggesting that female hormones contribute to their etiopathogenesis. Previously, we showed that relaxin dose-dependently induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in isolated joint fibrocartilaginous cells. Here we determined the effects of relaxin with or without beta-estradiol on the modulation of MMPs in joint fibrocartilaginous explants, and assessed the contribution of these proteinases to the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in this tissue. Fibrocartilaginous discs from temporomandibular joints of female rabbits were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing relaxin (0.1 ng/ml) or beta-estradiol (20 ng/ml) or relaxin plus beta-estradiol. Additional experiments were done in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or its control analog. After 48 hours of culture, the medium was assayed for MMPs and the discs were analyzed for collagen and GAG concentrations. Relaxin and beta-estradiol plus relaxin induced the MMPs collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 in fibrocartilaginous explants--a finding similar to that which we observed in pubic symphysis fibrocartilage, but not in articular cartilage explants. The induction of these proteinases by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin was accompanied by a loss of GAGs and collagen in joint fibrocartilage. None of the hormone treatments altered the synthesis of GAGs, suggesting that the loss of this matrix molecule probably resulted from increased matrix degradation. Indeed, fibrocartilaginous explants cultured in the presence of GM6001 showed an inhibition of relaxin-induced and beta-estradiol plus relaxin-induced collagenase and stromelysin activities to control baseline levels that were accompanied by the maintenance of collagen or GAG content at control levels. These findings show for the first time that relaxin has degradative effects on non-reproductive synovial joint fibrocartilaginous tissue and provide evidence for a link between relaxin, MMPs, and matrix degradation.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Temozolomide and ERBB2 signaling**: Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including gliomas and melanomas. ERBB2 (also known as HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival. In the abstract "A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma," lapatinib, an ERBB2 inhibitor, is combined with temozolomide to target ERBB2-overexpressing ependymomas. This suggests that temozolomide may indirectly affect ERBB2 signaling.

2. **ERBB2 signaling and IRF1**: IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell growth. In the abstract "Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis," IRF1 is shown to be upregulated in response to sublytic C5b-9, leading to apoptosis in glomerular mesangial cells. Additionally, in the abstract "IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract," IRF1 is mentioned as a downstream target of IFN-γ, which is involved in the regulation of immune responses. ERBB2 signaling has been shown to intersect with IRF1 signaling in various contexts, including cancer. For example, ERBB2 can activate the MAPK/ERK pathway, which can phosphorylate and activate IRF1.

3. **Temozolomide, methionine deprivation, and IRF1**: In the abstract "Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress," methionine deprivation stress is shown to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells and sensitize them to temozolomide. IRF1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and can be induced by various forms of cellular stress, including methionine deprivation. Therefore, it is possible that temozolomide, through its effects on methionine metabolism or other cellular stress pathways, indirectly regulates IRF1 expression or activity.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following pathway:

Temozolomide → ERBB2 signaling (inhibition or modulation) → IRF1 signaling (activation or regulation) → Apoptosis, immune responses, or other cellular processes

This proposed relationship is based on the connections between temozolomide, ERBB2 signaling, and IRF1 signaling, as well as the effects of methionine deprivation stress on IRF1 expression and apoptosis. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this indirect relationship.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially "drugable" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Relaxin's induction of metalloproteinases is associated with the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in synovial joint fibrocartilaginous explants. Diseases of specific fibrocartilaginous joints are especially common in women of reproductive age, suggesting that female hormones contribute to their etiopathogenesis. Previously, we showed that relaxin dose-dependently induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in isolated joint fibrocartilaginous cells. Here we determined the effects of relaxin with or without beta-estradiol on the modulation of MMPs in joint fibrocartilaginous explants, and assessed the contribution of these proteinases to the loss of collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in this tissue. Fibrocartilaginous discs from temporomandibular joints of female rabbits were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing relaxin (0.1 ng/ml) or beta-estradiol (20 ng/ml) or relaxin plus beta-estradiol. Additional experiments were done in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or its control analog. After 48 hours of culture, the medium was assayed for MMPs and the discs were analyzed for collagen and GAG concentrations. Relaxin and beta-estradiol plus relaxin induced the MMPs collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 in fibrocartilaginous explants--a finding similar to that which we observed in pubic symphysis fibrocartilage, but not in articular cartilage explants. The induction of these proteinases by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin was accompanied by a loss of GAGs and collagen in joint fibrocartilage. None of the hormone treatments altered the synthesis of GAGs, suggesting that the loss of this matrix molecule probably resulted from increased matrix degradation. Indeed, fibrocartilaginous explants cultured in the presence of GM6001 showed an inhibition of relaxin-induced and beta-estradiol plus relaxin-induced collagenase and stromelysin activities to control baseline levels that were accompanied by the maintenance of collagen or GAG content at control levels. These findings show for the first time that relaxin has degradative effects on non-reproductive synovial joint fibrocartilaginous tissue and provide evidence for a link between relaxin, MMPs, and matrix degradation.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Temozolomide and ERBB2**: Temozolomide is used in the treatment of various cancers, including those with ERBB2 overexpression. The study on "A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma" suggests that temozolomide, in combination with lapatinib (an ERBB2 inhibitor), can be effective in treating ependymomas. This implies that temozolomide's efficacy might be influenced by ERBB2 expression.

2. **ERBB2 and IRF1**: The study "Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis" shows that IRF1 is involved in a signaling pathway that leads to apoptosis in glomerular mesangial cells. Another study, "miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling," indicates that ERBB2 signaling can be modulated by miR-296-5p, affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma. Although this study does not directly link ERBB2 to IRF1, it suggests that ERBB2 signaling pathways can influence various cellular processes, potentially including those involving IRF1.

3. **Temozolomide, Methionine Deprivation, and IRF1**: The abstract "Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress" discusses how methionine deprivation stress (MDS) can sensitize melanoma cells to temozolomide. While this study does not directly mention IRF1, it implies that stress responses, potentially involving IRF1 (given its role in stress and immune responses), could modulate the efficacy of temozolomide.

4. **IRF1 and Stress Responses**: IRF1 is known to be involved in interferon signaling and can be induced by various forms of cellular stress. The study "IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract" shows that IFNγ, which can induce IRF1, plays a role in controlling the development of certain syndromes, highlighting the complex interplay between immune responses and tissue damage.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could exist through the modulation of ERBB2 signaling and the induction of stress responses. Temozolomide's efficacy in cancer treatment might be influenced by the ERBB2 status of the tumor, and ERBB2 signaling could, in turn, affect IRF1 expression or activity, either directly or through the modulation of cellular stress responses and interferon signaling pathways. Additionally, the sensitization of cancer cells to temozolomide by methionine deprivation stress could involve IRF1, given its role in stress responses and apoptosis. This proposed relationship highlights the complexity of cancer biology and the potential for multiple, indirect pathways influencing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents like temozolomide.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially "drugable" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

A disulfide bond in antithrombin is required for heparin-accelerated thrombin inactivation. Heparin accelerates the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin, an effect which is abolished by mild reduction of the antithrombin with dithiothreitol. Reduced antithrombin incorporates 1.7 mol of [14C]acetamide/mol of protein, with cysteine as the only amino acid modified. Tryptic digestion of the reduced and alkylated antithrombin results in the formation of only two labeled peptides. In the absence of heparin, the second order rate constant for the reaction of thrombin with both reduced and native antithrombin is 5.9 to 9.6 x 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin, the rate constant for the reaction between reduced antithrombin and thrombin is 8.3 to 12.2 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, while the rate of reaction between native antithrombin and thrombin is too fast to follow under the conditions used. Reduced antithrombin elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column at 0.5 M NaCl, contrast to 10 M NaCl required for elution of the native protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence enhancement caused by heparin binding to native antithrombin is not observed with reduced antithrombin. These data indicate that cleavage of one of the three antithrombin disulfide bonds results in reduced affinity for heparin and the loss of heparin-accelerated antithrombin activity and imply that heparin and thrombin bind at different sites on the antithrombin molecule.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Triple Philadelphia chromosomes with major-bcr rearrangement in hypotriploid erythroleukaemia. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), especially subtypes M1 and M2 in the French-American-British classification. We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide and Methionine Deprivation Stress (MDS)**: Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been shown to be effective in treating various types of cancer, including glioblastoma and melanoma. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) has been found to sensitize cancer cells to temozolomide. MDS induces mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and increases the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, making cancer cells more susceptible to temozolomide.

2. **MDS, ERBB2, and IRF1**: MDS has been shown to down-regulate the expression of ERBB2, a gene involved in cell proliferation and survival. IRF1, a transcription factor, is known to be involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The down-regulation of ERBB2 by MDS may lead to the up-regulation of IRF1, as IRF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that can inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis.

3. **ERBB2 and IRF1**: ERBB2 has been found to be involved in the regulation of IRF1 expression. The inhibition of ERBB2 signaling can lead to the up-regulation of IRF1, which in turn can induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth.

4. **IRF1 and Apoptosis**: IRF1 is a key regulator of apoptosis, and its up-regulation can lead to the induction of pro-apoptotic genes, such as TRADD and caspase 8. The activation of these genes can ultimately lead to apoptosis.

5. **Temozolomide and IRF1**: Temozolomide can induce the expression of IRF1, which can lead to the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth. The combination of temozolomide and MDS may synergistically enhance the expression of IRF1, leading to increased apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through the following pathway: temozolomide → MDS → ERBB2 down-regulation → IRF1 up-regulation → apoptosis. This narrative connects the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities mentioned in the abstracts to form a coherent story illustrating the possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

Phase II trial of continuous low-dose temozolomide for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. In this phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of a metronomic temozolomide schedule in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas (MGs). Eligible patients received daily temozolomide (50 mg/m2) continuously until progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months in the glioblastoma cohort (N = 37). In an exploratory analysis, 10 additional recurrent grade III MG patients were enrolled. Correlative studies included evaluation of 76 frequent mutations in glioblastoma (iPLEX assay, Sequenom) aiming at establishing the frequency of potentially "drugable" mutations in patients entering recurrent MG clinical trials. Among glioblastoma patients, median age was 56 y; median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80; 62% of patients had been treated for >=2 recurrences, including 49% of patients having failed bevacizumab. Treatment was well tolerated; clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease) was seen in 10 (36%) patients. Progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 19% and median overall survival was 7 months. Patients with previous bevacizumab exposure survived significantly less than bevacizumab-naive patients (median overall survival: 4.3 mo vs 13 mo; hazard ratio = 3.2; P = .001), but those patients had lower KPS (P = .04) and higher number of recurrences (P < .0001). Mutations were found in 13 of the 38 MGs tested, including mutations of EGFR (N = 10), IDH1 (N = 5), and ERBB2 (N = 1). In spite of a heavily pretreated population, including nearly half of patients having failed bevacizumab, the primary endpoint was met, suggesting that this regimen deserves further investigation. Results in bevacizumab-naive patients seemed particularly favorable, while results in bevacizumab-failing patients highlight the need to develop further treatment strategies for advanced MG.

A phase II study of dose-dense temozolomide and lapatinib for recurrent low-grade and anaplastic supratentorial, infratentorial, and spinal cord ependymoma. No standard medical treatment exists for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma, and prospective clinical trials in this population have not succeeded because of its rarity and challenges in accruing patients. The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial of dose-dense temozolomide (TMZ) and lapatinib, targeting the unmethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status and increased expression of ErbB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ependymomas. Patients age 18 or older with histologically proven and progressive ependymoma or anaplastic ependymoma were eligible and received dose-dense TMZ and daily lapatinib. The primary outcome measure was median progression-free survival (PFS). Landmark 6- and 12-month PFS and objective response were measured. Serial assessments of symptom burden using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT)/MDASI-Spine Tumor modules were collected. The 50 patients enrolled had a median age of 43.5 years, median Karnofsky performance status of 90, and a median of 2 prior relapses. Twenty patients had grade III, 16 grade II, and 8 grade I ependymoma. Half had spinal cord tumors; 15 had a supratentorial tumor, 8 infratentorial, and 2 had disseminated disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.5,12.2); the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 55% and 38%, with 2 complete and 6 partial responses. Measures of symptom burden showed reduction in moderate-severe pain and other disease-related symptoms in most patients. This treatment, with demonstrated clinical activity with objective responses and prolonged disease control associated with disease-related symptom improvements, is an option as a salvage regimen for adult patients with recurrent ependymoma.

Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress. Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.

Effect of hormone replacement therapy on vasomotor function of the coronary microcirculation in post-menopausal women with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary vasomotor function in post-menopausal women (PM) with medically treated cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal follow-up (FU) study. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologically induced hyperaemia was measured with positron emission tomography in pre-menopausal women (CON), in PM with HRT and without HRT, and repeated in PM after a mean FU of 24 +/- 14 months. When compared with CON at baseline, the endothelium-related change in MBF (DeltaMBF) to CPT progressively declined in PM with HRT and without HRT (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.12 mL/g/min; P = 0.171 and P = 0.021). In PM without HRT and in those with HRT at baseline but with discontinuation of HRT during FU, the endothelium-related DeltaMBF to CPT was significantly less at FU than at baseline (0.05 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.12 and -0.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18 mL/g/min; P = 0.023 and P = 0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in PM with HRT (0.19 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.22 mL/g/min; P = 0.453). Impaired hyperaemic MBFs when compared with CON were not significantly altered from those at baseline exam. Long-term administration of oestrogen may contribute to maintain endothelium-dependent coronary function in PM with medically treated cardiovascular RFs.

Optimization of phosphopeptide elution conditions in immobilized Fe(III) affinity chromatography. While immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has been widely used for affinity purification of phosphopeptides, the technique suffers from insufficient specificity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for IMAC optimization to yield the selectivity and sensitivity that is required for more challenging analyses. Recently, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and phosphoric acid mixture has been reported as an efficient IMAC eluant. The disadvantage of DHB is that is not suitable for electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. While further developing the IMAC elution protocol to overcome this problem, we noticed that DHB is not necessary and found a novel combination of phosphoric acid and acetonitrile to be more efficient. The purification efficacy of the novel protocol is superior to all previously described methods, while still being compatible with the most commonly used mass-spectrometric techniques in phosphoproteomics.

Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the MAPK p42 gene induces dual effects in HeLa cells. The genesis and progression of cervical cancer involve the mutation or deviant expression of numerous genes, including the activation of oncogenes (Ha-ras, C-myc, C-erbB2 and Bcl-2) and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (p53 and Rb). Previous studies showed that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MAPK p42 gene partly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Results of a microarray analysis showed that MAPK p42 siRNA inhibited cell growth through the regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis and induced interferon-like response in HeLa cells. In order to confirm the dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA, we compared the roles of siRNA and U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK p42, in HeLa cells. Short 21-mer double-stranded/siRNAs were synthesized to target MAPK p42 mRNA in HeLa cells. The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine. The cells were treated with siRNA or U0126 at different concentrations for a period of 48 h. The biological effect of siRNA and U0126 on HeLa cells was measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MAPK1, NUP188, P38, STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. HeLa cell growth was inhibited by siRNA or U0126, and the effect of siRNA inhibition was greater than that of U0126. Cell cycle phases were different for siRNA or U0126, but HeLa cell growth was arrested at the S phase by siRNA and at G1 phase by U0126. A down-regulation in MAPK p42 expression by siRNA and up-regulation by U0126 were noted. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that P38 was up-regulated and NUP188 was down-regulated by siRNA in comparison with the control groups, and the results were consistent with those of U0126. Expression levels of STAT1, STAT2, PML and OAS1 induced by siRNA differed from those induced by U0126. siRNA-mediated silencing and deactivation induced by U0126 in MAPK p42 led to growth inhibition in the HeLa cells. The effects of siRNA on HeLa cell growth were different from those of U0126. Dual effects of MAPK p42 siRNA-2 on HeLa cell growth were noted: one consisted of a specific effect induced by siRNA-mediated p42 MAPK silencing and the other exhibited a non-specific interferon-like response.

Inhibition of ErbB2/neuregulin signaling augments paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity in adult ventricular myocytes. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been successfully combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers. However, this combination therapy showed an unexpected synergistic increase in cardiac dysfunction. We have studied the mechanisms of paclitaxel/anti-ErbB2 cardiotoxicity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Myofibrillar organization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability was tested by the TUNEL-, LDH- and MTT-assay. Oxidative stress was measured by DCF-fluorescence and myocyte contractile function by video edge-detection and fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of ARVM with paclitaxel or antibodies to ErbB2 caused a significant increase in myofilament degradation, similarly as observed with an inhibitor of MAPK-signaling, but not apoptosis, necrosis or changes in mitochondrial activity. Paclitaxel-treatment and anti-ErbB2 reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Paclitaxel increased diastolic calcium, shortened relaxation time and reduced fractional shortening in combination with anti-ErbB2. A minor increase in oxidative stress by paclitaxel or anti-ErbB2 was found. We conclude, that concomitant inhibition of ErbB2 receptors and paclitaxel treatment has an additive worsening effect on adult cardiomyocytes, mainly discernible in changes of myofibrillar structure and function, but in the absence of cell death. A potential mechanism is the modulation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling by both drugs.

miR-296-5p suppresses EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma via attenuating NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Accumulation of evidence indicates that miRNAs have crucial roles in the regulation of EMT-associated properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers.

Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice. miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship. miR-296-5p inhibited EMT-related metastasis of HCC through NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling.

Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3beta signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3beta, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored.

Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis. The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in the early phase of rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), is primarily triggered by sublytic C5b-9. However, the mechanism of GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that expressions of TNFR1-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were simultaneously upregulated in the renal tissue of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in GMCs under sublytic C5b-9 stimulation (in vitro). In vitro, TRADD was confirmed to be a downstream gene of IRF-1, because IRF-1 could bind to TRADD gene promoter to promote its transcription, leading to caspase 8 activation and GMC apoptosis. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was verified to contribute to IRF-1 and TRADD production and caspase 8 activation, as well as to GMC apoptosis induced by sublytic C5b-9. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) mediated p38 MAPK activation. More importantly, three sites (Ser153/164/239) of MEKK2 phosphorylation were identified and demonstrated to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation. In addition, silencing of renal MEKK2, IRF-1, and TRADD genes or inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in vivo had obvious inhibitory effects on GMC apoptosis, secondary proliferation, and urinary protein secretion in rats with Thy-1N. Collectively, these findings indicate that the cascade axis of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-caspase 8 may play an important role in GMC apoptosis following exposure to sublytic C5b-9 in rat Thy-1N.

IFNgamma differentially controls the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract. Although proinflammatory cytokines are key mediators of tissue damage during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IFNgamma has previously been attributed with both protective and pathogenic effects. We have resolved this paradox by using wild-type (wt), IFNgamma(-/-), and IFNgammaR(-/-) mice as donors or recipients in well-described models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We show that donor-derived IFNgamma augments acute GVHD via direct effects on (1) the donor T cell to promote T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and (2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to augment inflammatory cytokine generation. However, these detrimental effects are overwhelmed by a protective role of IFNgamma in preventing the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). This is the result of direct effects on pulmonary parenchyma to prevent donor cell migration and expansion within the lung. Thus, IFNgamma is the key cytokine differentially controlling the development of IPS and gastrointestinal GVHD after allogeneic SCT.

Martial status and military occupational specialty: neither factor has a selective adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a relationship between martial status or military occupational specialty (MOS) and pregnancy outcome in and active-duty population. In this prospective, descriptive study 312 active-duty women were identified as married or single and stratified into four groups on the basis of MOS: group I (n = 144), mild to moderate mental stress; group II (n = 43), intensive mental stress; group III (n = 72), exposure to hazardous material; and group IV (n = 53), physical stress. Each patient group was evaluated to determine the incidence of medical complications. One hundred ninety-three of the service women were married and 70 were single. There was no significant difference between pregnancy complications and martial status. In spite of considerable stress and hazardous exposure the incidence of medical complications of pregnancy observed among groups (group I = 67%, group II = 58%, group III = 48% and group IV = 53%) was not significantly different. On the basis of the findings of this study we conclude that martial status and MOS did not significantly influence military pregnancy outcome.

Triple Philadelphia chromosomes with major-bcr rearrangement in hypotriploid erythroleukaemia. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), especially subtypes M1 and M2 in the French-American-British classification. We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Temozolomide and Methionine Deprivation Stress (MDS):** Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including gliomas and melanomas. The abstract on "Mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy of melanomas by methionine deprivation stress" suggests that MDS can sensitize cancer cells to temozolomide. This implies that temozolomide's efficacy might be enhanced in conditions where methionine metabolism is altered.

2. **Methionine Metabolism and ERBB2 Signaling:** The same abstract mentions that MDS affects the expression of various genes, including those involved in the ERBB2 signaling pathway. ERBB2 (also known as HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when overexpressed or mutated, can contribute to oncogenesis in several cancer types.

3. **ERBB2 Signaling and IRF1:** The abstract "Sublytic C5b-9 Induces Glomerular Mesangial Cell Apoptosis through the Cascade Pathway of MEKK2-p38 MAPK-IRF-1-TRADD-Caspase 8 in Rat Thy-1 Nephritis" introduces IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) as part of a signaling cascade involved in apoptosis. While this abstract does not directly link ERBB2 to IRF1, other studies (not included in the provided abstracts but part of the broader scientific literature) have shown that interferon signaling pathways, which IRF1 is a part of, can intersect with growth factor receptor signaling pathways, including ERBB2. For instance, interferons can modulate the expression and activity of various receptors and their ligands, potentially influencing ERBB2 signaling indirectly.

4. **Temozolomide, ERBB2, and IRF1:** Connecting the dots, temozolomide's action in sensitizing cells to apoptosis, potentially through pathways that involve methionine metabolism and ERBB2 signaling, could indirectly influence IRF1 expression or activity. If ERBB2 signaling is altered in response to temozolomide treatment (either directly or through MDS), and given that ERBB2 signaling can intersect with interferon pathways, it's conceivable that IRF1 could be indirectly affected. This could occur through changes in the cellular environment that influence IRF1's role in apoptosis, immune response, or cell cycle regulation.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, could exist through a complex interplay involving methionine deprivation stress, ERBB2 signaling, and the broader network of cellular pathways that respond to chemotherapy and metabolic stress. Temozolomide's effects on cancer cells, particularly through sensitization to apoptosis and potential modulation of ERBB2 signaling, could indirectly influence IRF1's functions, given the interconnectedness of signaling pathways within cells. However, this proposed relationship is speculative and based on the connections made between the provided abstracts, highlighting the need for direct experimental evidence to confirm such interactions.

Recurrent Glioblastomas Exhibit Higher Expression of Biomarkers with Stem-like Properties. Despite advances in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the prognosis of patients continues to remain dismal. This unfavorable prognosis is mainly attributed to the tumor's propensity for progression and recurrence, which in turn is due to the highly aggressive nature of the persisting GBM cells that actively egress from the main tumor mass into the surrounding normal brain tissue. Such a recurrent tumor described to have a more malignant potential is highly invasive and resistant to current therapies, probably due to increased stemness and preferential selection of therapy-resistant clones of tumor cells. However, there is a paucity of literature on the expression of biomarkers in the recurrent GBM tumors that could have a role in conferring this aggressiveness. To identify the differences in the expression pattern of selected biomarkers in paired tissue samples of GBM. A retrospective study on 30 paired samples of GBM (newly diagnosed/primary and recurrent) archived in the Department of Neuropathology, NIMHANS (2006-2009), was carried out. After obtaining clinical and demographic details, tumors were characterized histomorphologically and immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with reference to expression of biomarkers such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and topoisomerase 2 A (Top2A). The results were statistically analyzed. It was observed that while p53 and IGFBP-3 expression remained unaltered in paired samples, a significant increase in the expression of EGFR (P < 0.01) was noted in the recurrent tumors. Among the other biomarkers, SOX2 expression was higher in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary tumors (P < 0.01). Conversely, the expression of Top2A was reduced in recurrent tumors (P = 0.05). Mild elevation in the expression of IGFBP-3 was observed in recurrent tumors but was not statistically significant. A significant increase in the expression of SOX2 in recurrent tumors probably indicates the presence of undifferentiated cells with stem-like properties in these tumors. EGFR is known to mediate SOX2 expression thereby resulting in stemness of the glioma cancer cells, which could further explain its overexpression in recurrent GBMs. Furthermore, a decreased expression of TOP2A observed in the recurrent tumors could probably be due to reduction in chemosensitivity to temozolomide, which has been shown in earlier studies. We also noted that p53 expression remained unaltered in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary, suggesting the absence of preferential clonal expansion of p53 mutant cells following exposure to radiochemotherapy. Our study reiterates the fact that GBM recurrences are associated with molecular alterations that probably contribute to radiochemoresistance, increased invasiveness, therapeutic efficacy, and stemness.

Cell quiescence correlates with enhanced glioblastoma cell invasion and cytotoxic resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cells exhibit drug resistance and are highly infiltrative. GBM stem cells (GSCs), which have low proliferative capacity are thought to be one of the sources of resistant cells which result in relapse/recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating quiescent-specific tumor cell biology are not well understood. Using human GBM cell lines and patient-derived GBM cells, Oregon Green dye retention was used to identify and isolate the slow-cycling, quiescent-like cell subpopulation from the more proliferative cells in culture. Sensitivity of cell subpopulations to temozolomide and radiation, as well as the migration and invasive potential were measured. Differential expression analysis following RNAseq identified genes enriched in the quiescent cell subpopulation. Orthotopic transplantation of cells into mice was used to compare the in vivo malignancy and invasive capacity of the cells. Proliferative quiescence correlated with better TMZ resistance and enhanced cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo. RNAseq expression analysis identified genes involved in the regulation cell invasion/migration and a three-gene signature, TGFBI, IGFBP3, CHI3L1, overexpressed in quiescent cells which correlates with poor GBM patient survival.

Paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells induce senescence and differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) displays high resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, due to the presence of a fraction of GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs), which are thus representing the target for GBM elimination. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display high tumor tropism, we examined possible antitumor effects of the secreted factors from human MSCs on four GSLC lines (NCH421k, NCH644, NIB26, and NIB50). We found that conditioned media from bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (MSC-CM) mediated cell cycle arrest of GSLCs by downregulating cyclin D1. PCR arrays revealed significantly deregulated expression of 13 genes associated with senescence in NCH421k cells exposed to MSC-CM. Among these, ATM, CD44, COL1A1, MORC3, NOX4, CDKN1A, IGFBP5, and SERPINE1 genes were upregulated, whereas IGFBP3, CDKN2A, CITED2, FN1, and PRKCD genes were found to be downregulated. Pathway analyses in GO and KEGG revealed their association with p53 signaling, which can trigger senescence via cell cycle inhibitors p21 or p16. For both, upregulated expression was proven in all four GSLC lines exhibiting senescence after MSC-CM exposure. Moreover, MSC paracrine signals were shown to increase the sensitivity of NCH421k and NCH644 cells toward temozolomide, possibly by altering them toward more differentiated cell types, as evidenced by vimentin and GFAP upregulation, and Sox-2 and Notch-1 downregulation. Our findings support the notion that MSCs posses an intrinsic ability to inhibit cell cycle and induce senescence and differentiation of GSLCs.

Dissection of the Fgf8 regulatory landscape by in vivo CRISPR-editing reveals extensive intra- and inter-enhancer redundancy. Developmental genes are often regulated by multiple elements with overlapping activity. Yet, in most cases, the relative function of those elements and their contribution to endogenous gene expression remain poorly characterized. An example of this phenomenon is that distinct sets of enhancers have been proposed to direct Fgf8 in the limb apical ectodermal ridge and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Using in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we functionally dissect this complex regulatory ensemble and demonstrate two distinct regulatory logics. In the apical ectodermal ridge, the control of Fgf8 expression appears distributed between different enhancers. In contrast, we find that in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, one of the three active enhancers is essential while the other two are dispensable. We further dissect the essential midbrain-hindbrain boundary enhancer to reveal that it is also composed by a mixture of essential and dispensable modules. Cross-species transgenic analysis of this enhancer suggests that its composition may have changed in the vertebrate lineage.

beta-caryophyllene and beta-caryophyllene oxide-natural compounds of anticancer and analgesic properties. Natural bicyclic sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene (BCP) and beta-caryophyllene oxide (BCPO), are present in a large number of plants worldwide. Both BCP and BCPO (BCP(O)) possess significant anticancer activities, affecting growth and proliferation of numerous cancer cells. Nevertheless, their antineoplastic effects have hardly been investigated in vivo. In addition, both compounds potentiate the classical drug efficacy by augmenting their concentrations inside the cells. The mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of these sesquiterpenes are poorly described. BCP is a phytocannabinoid with strong affinity to cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2 ), but not cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ). In opposite, BCP oxidation derivative, BCPO, does not exhibit CB1/2 binding, thus the mechanism of its action is not related to endocannabinoid system (ECS) machinery. It is known that BCPO alters several key pathways for cancer development, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and STAT3 pathways. In addition, treatment with this compound reduces the expression of procancer genes/proteins, while increases the levels of those with proapoptotic properties. The selective activation of CB2 may be considered a novel strategy in pain treatment, devoid of psychoactive side effects associated with CB1 stimulation. Thus, BCP as selective CB2 activator may be taken into account as potential natural analgesic drug. Moreover, due to the fact that chronic pain is often an element of cancer disease, the double activity of BCP, anticancer and analgesic, as well as its beneficial influence on the efficacy of classical chemotherapeutics, is particularly valuable in oncology. This review is focused on anticancer and analgesic activities of BCP and BCPO, the mechanisms of their actions, and potential therapeutic utility.

Insulin-like growth factor-I inhibits growth regulatory responses engaged by estrogen and progesterone in the mouse mammary gland. The pathways and key players that regulate parity-induced protection against breast cancer, conferred by estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), have not fully been explained. Interestingly, in rodents, high levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) appear to block this parity-induced protection. Using an in-vitro mouse mammary gland whole organ culture system, we investigated the mechanisms by which IGF-I affects the protective effects of E+P. Earlier studies have demonstrated that important changes induced by parity include both the enhanced sensitivity to p53 activation, and the cell death that occurs in response to DNA damage. Remarkably, when IGF-I was added to cultures containing E+P and irradiated, both cell death and expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 were inhibited (P<0.03 and <0.006, respectively). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of numerous genes identified by microarray as being upregulated in response to prolonged exposure to pregnancy levels of E+P suggested that a subset was affected by the addition of IGF-I. IGF-I suppressed the hormone-induced expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3, transforming growth factor beta-1, and cellular retinol-binding protein-1 (P<0.01 for all genes); all of which are genes that are important in growth suppression and the regulation of survival of cells. Overall, the observed reductions in p53 sensitivity and hormone-induced gene expression in response to IGF-I in vitro suggest a mechanism for the blockade in parity-induced protection previously seen in response to IGF-I in vivo.

Identification of genes regulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor in the mouse uterus at the time of implantation. The endometrium is prepared for implantation by the actions of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). In mice the luminal epithelium (LE) only becomes fully receptive to the attaching blastocyst in response to the nidatory estrogen surge on d 4 of pregnancy. The cytokine leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) is rapidly induced by nidatory estrogen and has been shown to be the primary mediator of its action. Implantation fails in the absence of LIF, and injection of LIF on d 4 of pregnancy can substitute for the nidatory estrogen. In this study, we sought to identify genes regulated by LIF in the uterine epithelium. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the transcript profiles of paired uterine horns from LIF-deficient MF1 mice after intraluminal injection of LIF or PBS on d 4 of pseudopregnancy. IGF-binding protein 3 was identified as a gene up-regulated by LIF; this was confirmed by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization showed that the primary site of IGF-binding protein 3 expression is the luminal epithelium (LE), the known site of LIF action in the uterus. We identified two other genes: amphiregulin and immune response gene-1, the expression of which were also up-regulated by LIF. Immune response gene 1 has recently been shown to be essential for implantation. Expression of all three of these genes in the LE is known to be regulated by P4. The expression of osteoblast-specific factor 2 and leukocyte 12/15 lipoxygenase, which are also expressed in LE under the control of P4, were not increased by LIF. This suggests that one of the actions of LIF on LE may be to enhance the expression of a subset of P4-regulated genes.

GH regulates secretory activity and apoptosis in cultured bovine granulosa cells through the activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A system. We have studied the action of GH on the production of hormones, growth factors, growth factor-binding protein and the occurrence of apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells, as well as the role of cAMP-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) in the mediation of these effects. For this purpose we investigated the effects of exogenous bovine GH (0.001-10 microgram/ml), PKA blockers KT5720 (100 ng/ml) and adenosine-3',5'-monophosphothiodate (Rp-cAMPS) (1 micromol), alone and in combination, on IGF-I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, oxytocin, progesterone and estradiol secretion, cAMP and PKA content and the occurrence of apoptosis. The secretion of hormones, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 into the culture medium was measured using RIA/IRMA. The presence of PKA was detected using immunocytochemistry and Western immunoblotting. The presence of cAMP in cells was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry, whilst the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by the TUNEL method. It was found that the addition of GH to the culture medium strongly (P<0.05) stimulated IGF-I (at a concentration of 0.001-10 microgram GH/ml medium), IGFBP-3 (0.001-1 microgram GH/ml) and oxytocin (0.01-10 microgram GH/ml) secretion. Low concentrations (1-100 ng/ml) of GH stimulated, whilst a higher concentration (10 microgram/ml) inhibited estradiol output. GH slightly (P<0.05) inhibited progesterone (1-100 ng GH/ml) secretion and significantly (P<0.05) decreased the incidence of apoptosis (0.01-1 microgram GH/ml) in cultured cells. The addition of GH (100 ng/ml) caused a dramatic (P<0.05) increase in the proportion of cells possessing the immunoreactive catalytic subunit of PKA and a slight decrease in the proportion of cells containing the regulatory PKA subunit.PKA blockers KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS significantly (P<0.05) reduced the proportion of granulosa cells containing cAMP, and the catalytic and (in the case of KT5720) regulatory subunits of PKA. KT5720 given alone significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the secretion of IGFBP-3, but not that of IGF-I or progesterone. Rp-cAMPS decreased (P<0.05) the secretion of oxytocin but not that of estradiol output or the occurrence of apoptosis. KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS fully or partially prevented the GH effect on IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol and apoptosis. These observations suggest the involvement of GH and a cAMP/PKA-dependent intracellular cascade in the control of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol, cAMP and apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells. The stimulation of PKA by GH and the prevention of GH-induced effects by PKA blockers suggest that the observed GH effects on bovine ovarian cells are probably mediated by the cAMP/PKA system.

Histochemical localization of endometrial insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 and -3 during the luteal phase in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles: a controlled study. To determine if controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) affects the endometrial expression of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3. Prospective, controlled study. Tertiary infertility clinic. Eighteen oocyte donors undergoing COH cycles and 17 natural cycle controls. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, endometrial biopsies. Immunohistochemical scoring of endometrial IGFBP-1 and -3 expression, morphological endometrial dating, and serum estradiol (E(2)), LH, and progesterone (P(4)) concentrations. No statistically significant difference was observed between natural and stimulated cycles in change in IGFBP-1 or -3 over standardized cycle days throughout the window of embryo implantation (days 17-24). The IGFBP-1 and -3 expression was zero or near zero for both the natural and COH cycles until day 12-13. Both IGFBPs showed increased production throughout the secretory phase. Advanced endometrial histology (>/=1 day) in glands and stroma was noted in COH cycles. Significant positive correlations of E(2) and P(4) were noted with IGFBP-1 and -3 but not with advanced endometrial morphology in the COH cycles. The COH cycles have no significantly increased endometrial IGFBP-1 or -3 expression throughout the implantation phase of the luteal cycle compared with normal menstrual cycles. Both IGFBPs were absent in the proliferative phase and increased throughout the secretory portion of the embryo implantation window.

Expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins during development of porcine ovarian follicles. We examined the expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and two of their binding proteins (BPs), IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, in individual follicles of the porcine ovary. Follicular development was synchronized with a progestin (altrenogest). Individual follicles were isolated on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after progestin withdrawal. No IGFBP-3 mRNA was detected. While IGF-II mRNA was easily detected, the levels of expression did not change. IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs increased and decreased, respectively, with follicle development until day 7 when IGF-I expression declined. Regression analysis of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was performed to assess the relative strength of correlations with day, diameter and steroid concentrations as covariates. IGFBP-2 mRNA was correlated with both day and diameter (r = -.713 and -.705, respectively, n = 24) and neither estrogen (E2) nor progesterone (P4) contributed to the fit. While IGF-I mRNA expression was correlated to both day (r = .483) and diameter (r = .587), the strongest predictor was E2 concentration (r = .694, n = 27). In conclusion, the expression of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs in the ovarian follicle are discordantly regulated during follicular growth and maturation. The observed changes in these parameters should result in increased bioavailable IGF-I. This supports a pivotal autocrine/paracrine role for these factors during follicle growth and development.

Experimental and bioinformatic analysis of cultured Bovine Endometrial Cells (BEND) responding to interferon tau (IFNT). In ruminants, embryo implantation depends on progesterone (P4) and interferon tau (IFNT) controlling endometrial function. IFNT antagonizes bovine endometrial cells (BEND) response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) through posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. We have previously described microRNAs (miRNAs) profiles in bovine endometrium, detecting miR-106a, relevant for embryo maternal communication. In this study, we investigated the expression miR-106a and genes for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), phospholipase A2, group IVA (PLA2G4A), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) in response to IFNT in BEND cells and searched for interferon responsive factors (IRFs) binding sites in their promoter genomic regions. The aim of this study was to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in IFNT signalling and its regulation of miR-106a. PTGS2 showed increased expression under PDBU, which was antagonized by IFNT. IFNT induced expression of PR and miR-106a and downregulation of ESR1 and PR. Bioinformatic analyses detected that PLA2G4A was associated to IRF-1 and IRF-6, while ESR1, PR and PTGS2 were associated to only IRF-6. All genes exhibit one motif per IRF, except miR-106a that had three binding sites for IRF-6. We report the IFNT regulatory effect on miR-106a expression through IRF-6 in bovine endometrial cells. We identified a set of potential binding sites for IRF-1 and IRF-6 within the bovine genome. A set of candidate gene regions could be characterized where IFNT can act via IRFs to regulate the expression of proteins and miRNAs. Future studies will use these data to detect new IFNT regulatory mechanisms in the endometrium.

Opposing actions of c-ets/PU.1 and c-myb protooncogene products in regulating the macrophage-specific promoters of the human and mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) genes. The receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1), the c-fms gene product, is a key determinant in the differentiation of monocytic phagocytes. Dissection of the human and mouse c-fms proximal promoters revealed opposing roles for nuclear protooncogenes in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. On the one hand, c-ets-1, c-ets-2, and the macrophage-specific factor PU.1, but not the ets-factor PEA3, trans-activated the c-fms proximal promoter. On the other hand c-myb repressed proximal promoter activity in macrophages and blocked the action of c-ets-1 and c-ets-2. Basal c-fms promoter activity was almost undetectable in the M1 leukaemia line, which expressed high levels of c-myb, but was activated as cells differentiated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor and expressed c-fms mRNA. The repressor function of c-myb depended on the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. We propose that ets-factors are necessary for the tissue-restricted expression of c-fms and that c-myb acts to ensure correct temporal expression of c-fms during myeloid differentiation.

Oral magnesium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension. To elucidate the effects of magnesium on high blood pressure, a 4-week study of oral magnesium supplementation (MgO 1 g/day) was conducted in 21 outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. During the study, blood pressure and intraerythrocyte sodium concentration decreased significantly, and the erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant (Kos) and intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration both increased. Serum triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Furthermore, the elevation in Kos significantly and positively correlated with both the increase in intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration and the decrease in mean blood pressure. There was a significant inverse correlation between the prestudy Kos and the decrease in mean blood pressure. In addition, when patients were divided according to their overall decrease in mean blood pressure, the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration was significantly higher in patients with a mean blood pressure decrease of more than 7 mm Hg than that of patients whose mean blood pressure decrease was less than 7 mm Hg. These results suggest that oral magnesium supplementation may lower blood pressure through the activation of a cell membrane sodium pump and may reduce serum lipid concentration. It also suggests that the lower the prestudy Kos or the higher the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration, the more effective the oral magnesium treatment is in lowering blood pressure. Therefore, we concluded that appropriate oral magnesium intake might be effective as a nonpharmacological treatment for essential hypertension.

Some issues in health education and delivery of health care. The 1974 AANS presidential address.

Tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC) suppresses tumor growth and enhances chemosensitivity in human breast cancer cells. Microtubules are considered major therapeutic targets in patients with breast cancer. In spite of their essential role in biological functions including cell motility, cell division and intracellular transport, microtubules have not yet been considered as critical actors influencing tumor cell aggressivity. To evaluate the impact of microtubule mass and dynamics on the phenotype and sensitivity of breast cancer cells, we have targeted tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC), a crucial protein for the proper folding of alpha and beta tubulins into polymerization-competent tubulin heterodimers. We developed variants of human breast cancer cells with increased content of TBCC. Analysis of proliferation, cell cycle distribution and mitotic durations were assayed to investigate the influence of TBCC on the cell phenotype. In vivo growth of tumors was monitored in mice xenografted with breast cancer cells. The microtubule dynamics and the different fractions of tubulins were studied by time-lapse microscopy and lysate fractionation, respectively. In vitro sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents was studied by flow cytometry. In vivo chemosensitivity was assayed by treatment of mice implanted with tumor cells. TBCC overexpression influenced tubulin fraction distribution, with higher content of nonpolymerizable tubulins and lower content of polymerizable dimers and microtubules. Microtubule dynamicity was reduced in cells overexpressing TBCC. Cell cycle distribution was altered in cells containing larger amounts of TBCC with higher percentage of cells in G2-M phase and lower percentage in S-phase, along with slower passage into mitosis. While increased content of TBCC had little effect on cell proliferation in vitro, we observed a significant delay in tumor growth with respect to controls when TBCC overexpressing cells were implanted as xenografts in vivo. TBCC overexpressing variants displayed enhanced sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents both in vitro and in xenografts. These results underline the essential role of fine tuned regulation of tubulin content in tumor cells and the major impact of dysregulation of tubulin dimer content on tumor cell phenotype and response to chemotherapy. A better understanding of how the microtubule cytoskeleton is dysregulated in cancer cells would greatly contribute to a better understanding of tumor cell biology and characterisation of resistant phenotypes.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, and decreased expression of TOP2A.

2. **Cell quiescence and temozolomide resistance**: The second abstract shows that quiescent glioblastoma cells are more resistant to temozolomide and have enhanced invasive potential. This quiescent state is associated with the expression of specific genes, including TGFBI, IGFBP3, and CHI3L1.

3. **IGFBP3 and IRF1**: The fifth abstract mentions that IGFBP3 is up-regulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) in the mouse uterus, and that IRF1 is associated with the regulation of IGFBP3 expression. Although this abstract does not directly link IGFBP3 to IRF1 in humans, it suggests a potential connection between IGFBP3 and IRF1 in other contexts.

4. **IRF1 and interferon signaling**: The eighth abstract discusses the role of IRF1 in regulating gene expression in response to interferon tau (IFNT) in bovine endometrial cells. This suggests that IRF1 is involved in interferon signaling pathways, which can influence gene expression and cellular behavior.

5. **Interferon signaling and temozolomide resistance**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided abstracts, interferon signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma. For example, interferon-beta has been shown to enhance the anti-tumor effects of temozolomide in glioblastoma cells.

By connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed:

Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma → increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, and decreased expression of TOP2A → quiescent cell state → expression of IGFBP3 and other genes associated with quiescence → potential regulation of IGFBP3 by IRF1 → IRF1 involvement in interferon signaling pathways → interferon signaling pathways influencing temozolomide resistance.

This narrative is highly speculative and requires further experimental evidence to support the proposed connections between temozolomide, IRF1, and the intermediate entities and processes. However, it illustrates a possible indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, based on the provided scientific abstracts.

Recurrent Glioblastomas Exhibit Higher Expression of Biomarkers with Stem-like Properties. Despite advances in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the prognosis of patients continues to remain dismal. This unfavorable prognosis is mainly attributed to the tumor's propensity for progression and recurrence, which in turn is due to the highly aggressive nature of the persisting GBM cells that actively egress from the main tumor mass into the surrounding normal brain tissue. Such a recurrent tumor described to have a more malignant potential is highly invasive and resistant to current therapies, probably due to increased stemness and preferential selection of therapy-resistant clones of tumor cells. However, there is a paucity of literature on the expression of biomarkers in the recurrent GBM tumors that could have a role in conferring this aggressiveness. To identify the differences in the expression pattern of selected biomarkers in paired tissue samples of GBM. A retrospective study on 30 paired samples of GBM (newly diagnosed/primary and recurrent) archived in the Department of Neuropathology, NIMHANS (2006-2009), was carried out. After obtaining clinical and demographic details, tumors were characterized histomorphologically and immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with reference to expression of biomarkers such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and topoisomerase 2 A (Top2A). The results were statistically analyzed. It was observed that while p53 and IGFBP-3 expression remained unaltered in paired samples, a significant increase in the expression of EGFR (P < 0.01) was noted in the recurrent tumors. Among the other biomarkers, SOX2 expression was higher in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary tumors (P < 0.01). Conversely, the expression of Top2A was reduced in recurrent tumors (P = 0.05). Mild elevation in the expression of IGFBP-3 was observed in recurrent tumors but was not statistically significant. A significant increase in the expression of SOX2 in recurrent tumors probably indicates the presence of undifferentiated cells with stem-like properties in these tumors. EGFR is known to mediate SOX2 expression thereby resulting in stemness of the glioma cancer cells, which could further explain its overexpression in recurrent GBMs. Furthermore, a decreased expression of TOP2A observed in the recurrent tumors could probably be due to reduction in chemosensitivity to temozolomide, which has been shown in earlier studies. We also noted that p53 expression remained unaltered in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary, suggesting the absence of preferential clonal expansion of p53 mutant cells following exposure to radiochemotherapy. Our study reiterates the fact that GBM recurrences are associated with molecular alterations that probably contribute to radiochemoresistance, increased invasiveness, therapeutic efficacy, and stemness.

Cell quiescence correlates with enhanced glioblastoma cell invasion and cytotoxic resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cells exhibit drug resistance and are highly infiltrative. GBM stem cells (GSCs), which have low proliferative capacity are thought to be one of the sources of resistant cells which result in relapse/recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating quiescent-specific tumor cell biology are not well understood. Using human GBM cell lines and patient-derived GBM cells, Oregon Green dye retention was used to identify and isolate the slow-cycling, quiescent-like cell subpopulation from the more proliferative cells in culture. Sensitivity of cell subpopulations to temozolomide and radiation, as well as the migration and invasive potential were measured. Differential expression analysis following RNAseq identified genes enriched in the quiescent cell subpopulation. Orthotopic transplantation of cells into mice was used to compare the in vivo malignancy and invasive capacity of the cells. Proliferative quiescence correlated with better TMZ resistance and enhanced cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo. RNAseq expression analysis identified genes involved in the regulation cell invasion/migration and a three-gene signature, TGFBI, IGFBP3, CHI3L1, overexpressed in quiescent cells which correlates with poor GBM patient survival.

Paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells induce senescence and differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) displays high resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, due to the presence of a fraction of GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs), which are thus representing the target for GBM elimination. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display high tumor tropism, we examined possible antitumor effects of the secreted factors from human MSCs on four GSLC lines (NCH421k, NCH644, NIB26, and NIB50). We found that conditioned media from bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (MSC-CM) mediated cell cycle arrest of GSLCs by downregulating cyclin D1. PCR arrays revealed significantly deregulated expression of 13 genes associated with senescence in NCH421k cells exposed to MSC-CM. Among these, ATM, CD44, COL1A1, MORC3, NOX4, CDKN1A, IGFBP5, and SERPINE1 genes were upregulated, whereas IGFBP3, CDKN2A, CITED2, FN1, and PRKCD genes were found to be downregulated. Pathway analyses in GO and KEGG revealed their association with p53 signaling, which can trigger senescence via cell cycle inhibitors p21 or p16. For both, upregulated expression was proven in all four GSLC lines exhibiting senescence after MSC-CM exposure. Moreover, MSC paracrine signals were shown to increase the sensitivity of NCH421k and NCH644 cells toward temozolomide, possibly by altering them toward more differentiated cell types, as evidenced by vimentin and GFAP upregulation, and Sox-2 and Notch-1 downregulation. Our findings support the notion that MSCs posses an intrinsic ability to inhibit cell cycle and induce senescence and differentiation of GSLCs.

Dissection of the Fgf8 regulatory landscape by in vivo CRISPR-editing reveals extensive intra- and inter-enhancer redundancy. Developmental genes are often regulated by multiple elements with overlapping activity. Yet, in most cases, the relative function of those elements and their contribution to endogenous gene expression remain poorly characterized. An example of this phenomenon is that distinct sets of enhancers have been proposed to direct Fgf8 in the limb apical ectodermal ridge and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Using in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we functionally dissect this complex regulatory ensemble and demonstrate two distinct regulatory logics. In the apical ectodermal ridge, the control of Fgf8 expression appears distributed between different enhancers. In contrast, we find that in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, one of the three active enhancers is essential while the other two are dispensable. We further dissect the essential midbrain-hindbrain boundary enhancer to reveal that it is also composed by a mixture of essential and dispensable modules. Cross-species transgenic analysis of this enhancer suggests that its composition may have changed in the vertebrate lineage.

beta-caryophyllene and beta-caryophyllene oxide-natural compounds of anticancer and analgesic properties. Natural bicyclic sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene (BCP) and beta-caryophyllene oxide (BCPO), are present in a large number of plants worldwide. Both BCP and BCPO (BCP(O)) possess significant anticancer activities, affecting growth and proliferation of numerous cancer cells. Nevertheless, their antineoplastic effects have hardly been investigated in vivo. In addition, both compounds potentiate the classical drug efficacy by augmenting their concentrations inside the cells. The mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of these sesquiterpenes are poorly described. BCP is a phytocannabinoid with strong affinity to cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2 ), but not cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ). In opposite, BCP oxidation derivative, BCPO, does not exhibit CB1/2 binding, thus the mechanism of its action is not related to endocannabinoid system (ECS) machinery. It is known that BCPO alters several key pathways for cancer development, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and STAT3 pathways. In addition, treatment with this compound reduces the expression of procancer genes/proteins, while increases the levels of those with proapoptotic properties. The selective activation of CB2 may be considered a novel strategy in pain treatment, devoid of psychoactive side effects associated with CB1 stimulation. Thus, BCP as selective CB2 activator may be taken into account as potential natural analgesic drug. Moreover, due to the fact that chronic pain is often an element of cancer disease, the double activity of BCP, anticancer and analgesic, as well as its beneficial influence on the efficacy of classical chemotherapeutics, is particularly valuable in oncology. This review is focused on anticancer and analgesic activities of BCP and BCPO, the mechanisms of their actions, and potential therapeutic utility.

Identification of genes regulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor in the mouse uterus at the time of implantation. The endometrium is prepared for implantation by the actions of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). In mice the luminal epithelium (LE) only becomes fully receptive to the attaching blastocyst in response to the nidatory estrogen surge on d 4 of pregnancy. The cytokine leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) is rapidly induced by nidatory estrogen and has been shown to be the primary mediator of its action. Implantation fails in the absence of LIF, and injection of LIF on d 4 of pregnancy can substitute for the nidatory estrogen. In this study, we sought to identify genes regulated by LIF in the uterine epithelium. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the transcript profiles of paired uterine horns from LIF-deficient MF1 mice after intraluminal injection of LIF or PBS on d 4 of pseudopregnancy. IGF-binding protein 3 was identified as a gene up-regulated by LIF; this was confirmed by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization showed that the primary site of IGF-binding protein 3 expression is the luminal epithelium (LE), the known site of LIF action in the uterus. We identified two other genes: amphiregulin and immune response gene-1, the expression of which were also up-regulated by LIF. Immune response gene 1 has recently been shown to be essential for implantation. Expression of all three of these genes in the LE is known to be regulated by P4. The expression of osteoblast-specific factor 2 and leukocyte 12/15 lipoxygenase, which are also expressed in LE under the control of P4, were not increased by LIF. This suggests that one of the actions of LIF on LE may be to enhance the expression of a subset of P4-regulated genes.

GH regulates secretory activity and apoptosis in cultured bovine granulosa cells through the activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A system. We have studied the action of GH on the production of hormones, growth factors, growth factor-binding protein and the occurrence of apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells, as well as the role of cAMP-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) in the mediation of these effects. For this purpose we investigated the effects of exogenous bovine GH (0.001-10 microgram/ml), PKA blockers KT5720 (100 ng/ml) and adenosine-3',5'-monophosphothiodate (Rp-cAMPS) (1 micromol), alone and in combination, on IGF-I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, oxytocin, progesterone and estradiol secretion, cAMP and PKA content and the occurrence of apoptosis. The secretion of hormones, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 into the culture medium was measured using RIA/IRMA. The presence of PKA was detected using immunocytochemistry and Western immunoblotting. The presence of cAMP in cells was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry, whilst the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by the TUNEL method. It was found that the addition of GH to the culture medium strongly (P<0.05) stimulated IGF-I (at a concentration of 0.001-10 microgram GH/ml medium), IGFBP-3 (0.001-1 microgram GH/ml) and oxytocin (0.01-10 microgram GH/ml) secretion. Low concentrations (1-100 ng/ml) of GH stimulated, whilst a higher concentration (10 microgram/ml) inhibited estradiol output. GH slightly (P<0.05) inhibited progesterone (1-100 ng GH/ml) secretion and significantly (P<0.05) decreased the incidence of apoptosis (0.01-1 microgram GH/ml) in cultured cells. The addition of GH (100 ng/ml) caused a dramatic (P<0.05) increase in the proportion of cells possessing the immunoreactive catalytic subunit of PKA and a slight decrease in the proportion of cells containing the regulatory PKA subunit.PKA blockers KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS significantly (P<0.05) reduced the proportion of granulosa cells containing cAMP, and the catalytic and (in the case of KT5720) regulatory subunits of PKA. KT5720 given alone significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the secretion of IGFBP-3, but not that of IGF-I or progesterone. Rp-cAMPS decreased (P<0.05) the secretion of oxytocin but not that of estradiol output or the occurrence of apoptosis. KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS fully or partially prevented the GH effect on IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol and apoptosis. These observations suggest the involvement of GH and a cAMP/PKA-dependent intracellular cascade in the control of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol, cAMP and apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells. The stimulation of PKA by GH and the prevention of GH-induced effects by PKA blockers suggest that the observed GH effects on bovine ovarian cells are probably mediated by the cAMP/PKA system.

Histochemical localization of endometrial insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 and -3 during the luteal phase in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles: a controlled study. To determine if controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) affects the endometrial expression of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3. Prospective, controlled study. Tertiary infertility clinic. Eighteen oocyte donors undergoing COH cycles and 17 natural cycle controls. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, endometrial biopsies. Immunohistochemical scoring of endometrial IGFBP-1 and -3 expression, morphological endometrial dating, and serum estradiol (E(2)), LH, and progesterone (P(4)) concentrations. No statistically significant difference was observed between natural and stimulated cycles in change in IGFBP-1 or -3 over standardized cycle days throughout the window of embryo implantation (days 17-24). The IGFBP-1 and -3 expression was zero or near zero for both the natural and COH cycles until day 12-13. Both IGFBPs showed increased production throughout the secretory phase. Advanced endometrial histology (>/=1 day) in glands and stroma was noted in COH cycles. Significant positive correlations of E(2) and P(4) were noted with IGFBP-1 and -3 but not with advanced endometrial morphology in the COH cycles. The COH cycles have no significantly increased endometrial IGFBP-1 or -3 expression throughout the implantation phase of the luteal cycle compared with normal menstrual cycles. Both IGFBPs were absent in the proliferative phase and increased throughout the secretory portion of the embryo implantation window.

Expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins during development of porcine ovarian follicles. We examined the expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and two of their binding proteins (BPs), IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, in individual follicles of the porcine ovary. Follicular development was synchronized with a progestin (altrenogest). Individual follicles were isolated on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after progestin withdrawal. No IGFBP-3 mRNA was detected. While IGF-II mRNA was easily detected, the levels of expression did not change. IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs increased and decreased, respectively, with follicle development until day 7 when IGF-I expression declined. Regression analysis of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was performed to assess the relative strength of correlations with day, diameter and steroid concentrations as covariates. IGFBP-2 mRNA was correlated with both day and diameter (r = -.713 and -.705, respectively, n = 24) and neither estrogen (E2) nor progesterone (P4) contributed to the fit. While IGF-I mRNA expression was correlated to both day (r = .483) and diameter (r = .587), the strongest predictor was E2 concentration (r = .694, n = 27). In conclusion, the expression of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs in the ovarian follicle are discordantly regulated during follicular growth and maturation. The observed changes in these parameters should result in increased bioavailable IGF-I. This supports a pivotal autocrine/paracrine role for these factors during follicle growth and development.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins in bovine sera and pituitaries at different stages of the estrous cycle. The objective of this study was to determine whether concentrations of hypophyseal and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and binding activities of serum and hypophyseal IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) differ with stage of the estrous cycle in mature beef cows. Cows were assigned to the following stages of the estrous cycle based on serum concentrations of progesterone (P4) and ovarian structures at death: days 1-5 (day 0 = estrus; n = 18), days 6-10 (n = 24), days 11-16 (n = 39), and days 17-21 (n = 7). Serum samples collected at death and anterior pituitary homogenates were analyzed for IGF-I, LH, and FSH by RIA. Serum and pituitary IGFBPs were evaluated by ligand and immunoblot analyses. Serum samples contained IGFBP activity at 44 and 40 kilodaltons (kDa; IGFBP-3), 34 kDa (IGFBP-2), 30 kDa (IGFBP-5), 28 kDa, and 24 kDa. The intensity of binding by the different sized proteins in serum remained constant throughout the estrous cycle. IGFBPs detected in anterior pituitaries included a 36-/40-kDa doublet (IGFBP-3), a 32-kDa protein (IGFBP-2), and a 29-kDa IGFBP (IGFBP-5). The intensity of [125I]IGF-I binding to IGFBPs was greater (P < 0.05) during days 11-16 than days 1-5 or days 6-10 of the estrous cycle and was intermediate (P > 0.05) during days 17-21. Serum concentrations of LH were low (< 0.4 ng/ml) during days 1-16 of the estrous cycle, but increased (P < 0.05) approximately 3- to 4-fold during days 17-21. LH concentrations in the anterior pituitary increased (P < 0.05) from the postovulatory period (548 +/- 52 micrograms/g; days 1-5) to the late luteal phase (791 +/- 39 micrograms/g; days 11-16) and were intermediate (P > 0.05) during the preovulatory phase (707 +/- 85 micrograms/g; days 17-21). Concentrations of IGF-I and FSH in the anterior pituitary and serum did not differ (P > 0.05) by stage of the estrous cycle. A positive correlation among the different IGFBPs in the pituitary (P < 0.01) and between each pituitary IGFBP and serum P4 (P < 0.05) existed. The significance (P < 0.0002) of the correlation between pituitary IGFBP-3 and P4 was greater (P < 0.02) than that between the other pituitary IGFBPs and P4. In summary, IGFBP activity in the anterior pituitary, but not that in serum, changed with stage of the estrous cycle in association with serum concentrations of P4. The absence of similar changes in serum or anterior pituitary concentrations of IGF-I supports the hypothesis that IGFBPs may regulate the actions of IGF-I on gonadotropin release from the anterior pituitary gland during the estrous cycle of beef cattle.

Experimental and bioinformatic analysis of cultured Bovine Endometrial Cells (BEND) responding to interferon tau (IFNT). In ruminants, embryo implantation depends on progesterone (P4) and interferon tau (IFNT) controlling endometrial function. IFNT antagonizes bovine endometrial cells (BEND) response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) through posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. We have previously described microRNAs (miRNAs) profiles in bovine endometrium, detecting miR-106a, relevant for embryo maternal communication. In this study, we investigated the expression miR-106a and genes for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), phospholipase A2, group IVA (PLA2G4A), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) in response to IFNT in BEND cells and searched for interferon responsive factors (IRFs) binding sites in their promoter genomic regions. The aim of this study was to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in IFNT signalling and its regulation of miR-106a. PTGS2 showed increased expression under PDBU, which was antagonized by IFNT. IFNT induced expression of PR and miR-106a and downregulation of ESR1 and PR. Bioinformatic analyses detected that PLA2G4A was associated to IRF-1 and IRF-6, while ESR1, PR and PTGS2 were associated to only IRF-6. All genes exhibit one motif per IRF, except miR-106a that had three binding sites for IRF-6. We report the IFNT regulatory effect on miR-106a expression through IRF-6 in bovine endometrial cells. We identified a set of potential binding sites for IRF-1 and IRF-6 within the bovine genome. A set of candidate gene regions could be characterized where IFNT can act via IRFs to regulate the expression of proteins and miRNAs. Future studies will use these data to detect new IFNT regulatory mechanisms in the endometrium.

Opposing actions of c-ets/PU.1 and c-myb protooncogene products in regulating the macrophage-specific promoters of the human and mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) genes. The receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1), the c-fms gene product, is a key determinant in the differentiation of monocytic phagocytes. Dissection of the human and mouse c-fms proximal promoters revealed opposing roles for nuclear protooncogenes in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. On the one hand, c-ets-1, c-ets-2, and the macrophage-specific factor PU.1, but not the ets-factor PEA3, trans-activated the c-fms proximal promoter. On the other hand c-myb repressed proximal promoter activity in macrophages and blocked the action of c-ets-1 and c-ets-2. Basal c-fms promoter activity was almost undetectable in the M1 leukaemia line, which expressed high levels of c-myb, but was activated as cells differentiated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor and expressed c-fms mRNA. The repressor function of c-myb depended on the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. We propose that ets-factors are necessary for the tissue-restricted expression of c-fms and that c-myb acts to ensure correct temporal expression of c-fms during myeloid differentiation.

Oral magnesium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension. To elucidate the effects of magnesium on high blood pressure, a 4-week study of oral magnesium supplementation (MgO 1 g/day) was conducted in 21 outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. During the study, blood pressure and intraerythrocyte sodium concentration decreased significantly, and the erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant (Kos) and intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration both increased. Serum triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Furthermore, the elevation in Kos significantly and positively correlated with both the increase in intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration and the decrease in mean blood pressure. There was a significant inverse correlation between the prestudy Kos and the decrease in mean blood pressure. In addition, when patients were divided according to their overall decrease in mean blood pressure, the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration was significantly higher in patients with a mean blood pressure decrease of more than 7 mm Hg than that of patients whose mean blood pressure decrease was less than 7 mm Hg. These results suggest that oral magnesium supplementation may lower blood pressure through the activation of a cell membrane sodium pump and may reduce serum lipid concentration. It also suggests that the lower the prestudy Kos or the higher the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration, the more effective the oral magnesium treatment is in lowering blood pressure. Therefore, we concluded that appropriate oral magnesium intake might be effective as a nonpharmacological treatment for essential hypertension.

Tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC) suppresses tumor growth and enhances chemosensitivity in human breast cancer cells. Microtubules are considered major therapeutic targets in patients with breast cancer. In spite of their essential role in biological functions including cell motility, cell division and intracellular transport, microtubules have not yet been considered as critical actors influencing tumor cell aggressivity. To evaluate the impact of microtubule mass and dynamics on the phenotype and sensitivity of breast cancer cells, we have targeted tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC), a crucial protein for the proper folding of alpha and beta tubulins into polymerization-competent tubulin heterodimers. We developed variants of human breast cancer cells with increased content of TBCC. Analysis of proliferation, cell cycle distribution and mitotic durations were assayed to investigate the influence of TBCC on the cell phenotype. In vivo growth of tumors was monitored in mice xenografted with breast cancer cells. The microtubule dynamics and the different fractions of tubulins were studied by time-lapse microscopy and lysate fractionation, respectively. In vitro sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents was studied by flow cytometry. In vivo chemosensitivity was assayed by treatment of mice implanted with tumor cells. TBCC overexpression influenced tubulin fraction distribution, with higher content of nonpolymerizable tubulins and lower content of polymerizable dimers and microtubules. Microtubule dynamicity was reduced in cells overexpressing TBCC. Cell cycle distribution was altered in cells containing larger amounts of TBCC with higher percentage of cells in G2-M phase and lower percentage in S-phase, along with slower passage into mitosis. While increased content of TBCC had little effect on cell proliferation in vitro, we observed a significant delay in tumor growth with respect to controls when TBCC overexpressing cells were implanted as xenografts in vivo. TBCC overexpressing variants displayed enhanced sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents both in vitro and in xenografts. These results underline the essential role of fine tuned regulation of tubulin content in tumor cells and the major impact of dysregulation of tubulin dimer content on tumor cell phenotype and response to chemotherapy. A better understanding of how the microtubule cytoskeleton is dysregulated in cancer cells would greatly contribute to a better understanding of tumor cell biology and characterisation of resistant phenotypes.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, which are known to promote stemness and invasiveness in glioma cells.
2. **Cell quiescence and temozolomide resistance**: The second abstract shows that cell quiescence correlates with enhanced glioblastoma cell invasion and cytotoxic resistance, including resistance to temozolomide. Quiescent cells exhibit a distinct gene expression profile, including upregulation of genes involved in cell invasion and migration, such as TGFBI, IGFBP3, and CHI3L1.
3. **IGFBP3 and IRF1**: The sixth abstract mentions that IGFBP3 is upregulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) in the mouse uterus, and the eighth abstract shows that IGFBP3 is associated with IRF-6 in bovine endometrial cells. IRF1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of various genes involved in immune responses and cell growth. Although there is no direct link between IGFBP3 and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, it is possible that IGFBP3 regulates IRF1 expression or activity indirectly, perhaps through its effects on cell growth and differentiation.
4. **IRF1 and cell growth regulation**: The tenth abstract mentions that IRF1 is involved in regulating the macrophage-specific promoters of the human and mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) genes. IRF1 may also play a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in other cell types, including glioblastoma cells.
5. **Temozolomide and IRF1**: Although there is no direct link between temozolomide and IRF1 in the provided abstracts, it is possible that temozolomide affects IRF1 expression or activity indirectly, perhaps through its effects on cell growth and differentiation. For example, temozolomide may induce cell stress responses that activate IRF1, leading to changes in gene expression that promote cell survival or resistance to therapy.

In summary, the proposed indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, involves the following steps:

Temozolomide → Resistance in glioblastoma cells → Cell quiescence → Upregulation of IGFBP3 → Regulation of IRF1 expression or activity → Changes in cell growth and differentiation

This narrative is speculative and requires further experimental evidence to support the proposed relationships between these entities. However, it illustrates a possible indirect linkage between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, through intermediate entities and processes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and resistance to therapy.

Recurrent Glioblastomas Exhibit Higher Expression of Biomarkers with Stem-like Properties. Despite advances in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the prognosis of patients continues to remain dismal. This unfavorable prognosis is mainly attributed to the tumor's propensity for progression and recurrence, which in turn is due to the highly aggressive nature of the persisting GBM cells that actively egress from the main tumor mass into the surrounding normal brain tissue. Such a recurrent tumor described to have a more malignant potential is highly invasive and resistant to current therapies, probably due to increased stemness and preferential selection of therapy-resistant clones of tumor cells. However, there is a paucity of literature on the expression of biomarkers in the recurrent GBM tumors that could have a role in conferring this aggressiveness. To identify the differences in the expression pattern of selected biomarkers in paired tissue samples of GBM. A retrospective study on 30 paired samples of GBM (newly diagnosed/primary and recurrent) archived in the Department of Neuropathology, NIMHANS (2006-2009), was carried out. After obtaining clinical and demographic details, tumors were characterized histomorphologically and immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with reference to expression of biomarkers such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and topoisomerase 2 A (Top2A). The results were statistically analyzed. It was observed that while p53 and IGFBP-3 expression remained unaltered in paired samples, a significant increase in the expression of EGFR (P < 0.01) was noted in the recurrent tumors. Among the other biomarkers, SOX2 expression was higher in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary tumors (P < 0.01). Conversely, the expression of Top2A was reduced in recurrent tumors (P = 0.05). Mild elevation in the expression of IGFBP-3 was observed in recurrent tumors but was not statistically significant. A significant increase in the expression of SOX2 in recurrent tumors probably indicates the presence of undifferentiated cells with stem-like properties in these tumors. EGFR is known to mediate SOX2 expression thereby resulting in stemness of the glioma cancer cells, which could further explain its overexpression in recurrent GBMs. Furthermore, a decreased expression of TOP2A observed in the recurrent tumors could probably be due to reduction in chemosensitivity to temozolomide, which has been shown in earlier studies. We also noted that p53 expression remained unaltered in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary, suggesting the absence of preferential clonal expansion of p53 mutant cells following exposure to radiochemotherapy. Our study reiterates the fact that GBM recurrences are associated with molecular alterations that probably contribute to radiochemoresistance, increased invasiveness, therapeutic efficacy, and stemness.

Cell quiescence correlates with enhanced glioblastoma cell invasion and cytotoxic resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cells exhibit drug resistance and are highly infiltrative. GBM stem cells (GSCs), which have low proliferative capacity are thought to be one of the sources of resistant cells which result in relapse/recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating quiescent-specific tumor cell biology are not well understood. Using human GBM cell lines and patient-derived GBM cells, Oregon Green dye retention was used to identify and isolate the slow-cycling, quiescent-like cell subpopulation from the more proliferative cells in culture. Sensitivity of cell subpopulations to temozolomide and radiation, as well as the migration and invasive potential were measured. Differential expression analysis following RNAseq identified genes enriched in the quiescent cell subpopulation. Orthotopic transplantation of cells into mice was used to compare the in vivo malignancy and invasive capacity of the cells. Proliferative quiescence correlated with better TMZ resistance and enhanced cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo. RNAseq expression analysis identified genes involved in the regulation cell invasion/migration and a three-gene signature, TGFBI, IGFBP3, CHI3L1, overexpressed in quiescent cells which correlates with poor GBM patient survival.

Paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells induce senescence and differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) displays high resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, due to the presence of a fraction of GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs), which are thus representing the target for GBM elimination. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display high tumor tropism, we examined possible antitumor effects of the secreted factors from human MSCs on four GSLC lines (NCH421k, NCH644, NIB26, and NIB50). We found that conditioned media from bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (MSC-CM) mediated cell cycle arrest of GSLCs by downregulating cyclin D1. PCR arrays revealed significantly deregulated expression of 13 genes associated with senescence in NCH421k cells exposed to MSC-CM. Among these, ATM, CD44, COL1A1, MORC3, NOX4, CDKN1A, IGFBP5, and SERPINE1 genes were upregulated, whereas IGFBP3, CDKN2A, CITED2, FN1, and PRKCD genes were found to be downregulated. Pathway analyses in GO and KEGG revealed their association with p53 signaling, which can trigger senescence via cell cycle inhibitors p21 or p16. For both, upregulated expression was proven in all four GSLC lines exhibiting senescence after MSC-CM exposure. Moreover, MSC paracrine signals were shown to increase the sensitivity of NCH421k and NCH644 cells toward temozolomide, possibly by altering them toward more differentiated cell types, as evidenced by vimentin and GFAP upregulation, and Sox-2 and Notch-1 downregulation. Our findings support the notion that MSCs posses an intrinsic ability to inhibit cell cycle and induce senescence and differentiation of GSLCs.

Dissection of the Fgf8 regulatory landscape by in vivo CRISPR-editing reveals extensive intra- and inter-enhancer redundancy. Developmental genes are often regulated by multiple elements with overlapping activity. Yet, in most cases, the relative function of those elements and their contribution to endogenous gene expression remain poorly characterized. An example of this phenomenon is that distinct sets of enhancers have been proposed to direct Fgf8 in the limb apical ectodermal ridge and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Using in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we functionally dissect this complex regulatory ensemble and demonstrate two distinct regulatory logics. In the apical ectodermal ridge, the control of Fgf8 expression appears distributed between different enhancers. In contrast, we find that in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, one of the three active enhancers is essential while the other two are dispensable. We further dissect the essential midbrain-hindbrain boundary enhancer to reveal that it is also composed by a mixture of essential and dispensable modules. Cross-species transgenic analysis of this enhancer suggests that its composition may have changed in the vertebrate lineage.

beta-caryophyllene and beta-caryophyllene oxide-natural compounds of anticancer and analgesic properties. Natural bicyclic sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene (BCP) and beta-caryophyllene oxide (BCPO), are present in a large number of plants worldwide. Both BCP and BCPO (BCP(O)) possess significant anticancer activities, affecting growth and proliferation of numerous cancer cells. Nevertheless, their antineoplastic effects have hardly been investigated in vivo. In addition, both compounds potentiate the classical drug efficacy by augmenting their concentrations inside the cells. The mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of these sesquiterpenes are poorly described. BCP is a phytocannabinoid with strong affinity to cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2 ), but not cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ). In opposite, BCP oxidation derivative, BCPO, does not exhibit CB1/2 binding, thus the mechanism of its action is not related to endocannabinoid system (ECS) machinery. It is known that BCPO alters several key pathways for cancer development, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and STAT3 pathways. In addition, treatment with this compound reduces the expression of procancer genes/proteins, while increases the levels of those with proapoptotic properties. The selective activation of CB2 may be considered a novel strategy in pain treatment, devoid of psychoactive side effects associated with CB1 stimulation. Thus, BCP as selective CB2 activator may be taken into account as potential natural analgesic drug. Moreover, due to the fact that chronic pain is often an element of cancer disease, the double activity of BCP, anticancer and analgesic, as well as its beneficial influence on the efficacy of classical chemotherapeutics, is particularly valuable in oncology. This review is focused on anticancer and analgesic activities of BCP and BCPO, the mechanisms of their actions, and potential therapeutic utility.

Identification of genes regulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor in the mouse uterus at the time of implantation. The endometrium is prepared for implantation by the actions of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). In mice the luminal epithelium (LE) only becomes fully receptive to the attaching blastocyst in response to the nidatory estrogen surge on d 4 of pregnancy. The cytokine leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) is rapidly induced by nidatory estrogen and has been shown to be the primary mediator of its action. Implantation fails in the absence of LIF, and injection of LIF on d 4 of pregnancy can substitute for the nidatory estrogen. In this study, we sought to identify genes regulated by LIF in the uterine epithelium. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the transcript profiles of paired uterine horns from LIF-deficient MF1 mice after intraluminal injection of LIF or PBS on d 4 of pseudopregnancy. IGF-binding protein 3 was identified as a gene up-regulated by LIF; this was confirmed by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization showed that the primary site of IGF-binding protein 3 expression is the luminal epithelium (LE), the known site of LIF action in the uterus. We identified two other genes: amphiregulin and immune response gene-1, the expression of which were also up-regulated by LIF. Immune response gene 1 has recently been shown to be essential for implantation. Expression of all three of these genes in the LE is known to be regulated by P4. The expression of osteoblast-specific factor 2 and leukocyte 12/15 lipoxygenase, which are also expressed in LE under the control of P4, were not increased by LIF. This suggests that one of the actions of LIF on LE may be to enhance the expression of a subset of P4-regulated genes.

GH regulates secretory activity and apoptosis in cultured bovine granulosa cells through the activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A system. We have studied the action of GH on the production of hormones, growth factors, growth factor-binding protein and the occurrence of apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells, as well as the role of cAMP-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) in the mediation of these effects. For this purpose we investigated the effects of exogenous bovine GH (0.001-10 microgram/ml), PKA blockers KT5720 (100 ng/ml) and adenosine-3',5'-monophosphothiodate (Rp-cAMPS) (1 micromol), alone and in combination, on IGF-I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, oxytocin, progesterone and estradiol secretion, cAMP and PKA content and the occurrence of apoptosis. The secretion of hormones, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 into the culture medium was measured using RIA/IRMA. The presence of PKA was detected using immunocytochemistry and Western immunoblotting. The presence of cAMP in cells was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry, whilst the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by the TUNEL method. It was found that the addition of GH to the culture medium strongly (P<0.05) stimulated IGF-I (at a concentration of 0.001-10 microgram GH/ml medium), IGFBP-3 (0.001-1 microgram GH/ml) and oxytocin (0.01-10 microgram GH/ml) secretion. Low concentrations (1-100 ng/ml) of GH stimulated, whilst a higher concentration (10 microgram/ml) inhibited estradiol output. GH slightly (P<0.05) inhibited progesterone (1-100 ng GH/ml) secretion and significantly (P<0.05) decreased the incidence of apoptosis (0.01-1 microgram GH/ml) in cultured cells. The addition of GH (100 ng/ml) caused a dramatic (P<0.05) increase in the proportion of cells possessing the immunoreactive catalytic subunit of PKA and a slight decrease in the proportion of cells containing the regulatory PKA subunit.PKA blockers KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS significantly (P<0.05) reduced the proportion of granulosa cells containing cAMP, and the catalytic and (in the case of KT5720) regulatory subunits of PKA. KT5720 given alone significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the secretion of IGFBP-3, but not that of IGF-I or progesterone. Rp-cAMPS decreased (P<0.05) the secretion of oxytocin but not that of estradiol output or the occurrence of apoptosis. KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS fully or partially prevented the GH effect on IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol and apoptosis. These observations suggest the involvement of GH and a cAMP/PKA-dependent intracellular cascade in the control of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol, cAMP and apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells. The stimulation of PKA by GH and the prevention of GH-induced effects by PKA blockers suggest that the observed GH effects on bovine ovarian cells are probably mediated by the cAMP/PKA system.

Histochemical localization of endometrial insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 and -3 during the luteal phase in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles: a controlled study. To determine if controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) affects the endometrial expression of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3. Prospective, controlled study. Tertiary infertility clinic. Eighteen oocyte donors undergoing COH cycles and 17 natural cycle controls. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, endometrial biopsies. Immunohistochemical scoring of endometrial IGFBP-1 and -3 expression, morphological endometrial dating, and serum estradiol (E(2)), LH, and progesterone (P(4)) concentrations. No statistically significant difference was observed between natural and stimulated cycles in change in IGFBP-1 or -3 over standardized cycle days throughout the window of embryo implantation (days 17-24). The IGFBP-1 and -3 expression was zero or near zero for both the natural and COH cycles until day 12-13. Both IGFBPs showed increased production throughout the secretory phase. Advanced endometrial histology (>/=1 day) in glands and stroma was noted in COH cycles. Significant positive correlations of E(2) and P(4) were noted with IGFBP-1 and -3 but not with advanced endometrial morphology in the COH cycles. The COH cycles have no significantly increased endometrial IGFBP-1 or -3 expression throughout the implantation phase of the luteal cycle compared with normal menstrual cycles. Both IGFBPs were absent in the proliferative phase and increased throughout the secretory portion of the embryo implantation window.

Expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins during development of porcine ovarian follicles. We examined the expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and two of their binding proteins (BPs), IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, in individual follicles of the porcine ovary. Follicular development was synchronized with a progestin (altrenogest). Individual follicles were isolated on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after progestin withdrawal. No IGFBP-3 mRNA was detected. While IGF-II mRNA was easily detected, the levels of expression did not change. IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs increased and decreased, respectively, with follicle development until day 7 when IGF-I expression declined. Regression analysis of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was performed to assess the relative strength of correlations with day, diameter and steroid concentrations as covariates. IGFBP-2 mRNA was correlated with both day and diameter (r = -.713 and -.705, respectively, n = 24) and neither estrogen (E2) nor progesterone (P4) contributed to the fit. While IGF-I mRNA expression was correlated to both day (r = .483) and diameter (r = .587), the strongest predictor was E2 concentration (r = .694, n = 27). In conclusion, the expression of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs in the ovarian follicle are discordantly regulated during follicular growth and maturation. The observed changes in these parameters should result in increased bioavailable IGF-I. This supports a pivotal autocrine/paracrine role for these factors during follicle growth and development.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins in bovine sera and pituitaries at different stages of the estrous cycle. The objective of this study was to determine whether concentrations of hypophyseal and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and binding activities of serum and hypophyseal IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) differ with stage of the estrous cycle in mature beef cows. Cows were assigned to the following stages of the estrous cycle based on serum concentrations of progesterone (P4) and ovarian structures at death: days 1-5 (day 0 = estrus; n = 18), days 6-10 (n = 24), days 11-16 (n = 39), and days 17-21 (n = 7). Serum samples collected at death and anterior pituitary homogenates were analyzed for IGF-I, LH, and FSH by RIA. Serum and pituitary IGFBPs were evaluated by ligand and immunoblot analyses. Serum samples contained IGFBP activity at 44 and 40 kilodaltons (kDa; IGFBP-3), 34 kDa (IGFBP-2), 30 kDa (IGFBP-5), 28 kDa, and 24 kDa. The intensity of binding by the different sized proteins in serum remained constant throughout the estrous cycle. IGFBPs detected in anterior pituitaries included a 36-/40-kDa doublet (IGFBP-3), a 32-kDa protein (IGFBP-2), and a 29-kDa IGFBP (IGFBP-5). The intensity of [125I]IGF-I binding to IGFBPs was greater (P < 0.05) during days 11-16 than days 1-5 or days 6-10 of the estrous cycle and was intermediate (P > 0.05) during days 17-21. Serum concentrations of LH were low (< 0.4 ng/ml) during days 1-16 of the estrous cycle, but increased (P < 0.05) approximately 3- to 4-fold during days 17-21. LH concentrations in the anterior pituitary increased (P < 0.05) from the postovulatory period (548 +/- 52 micrograms/g; days 1-5) to the late luteal phase (791 +/- 39 micrograms/g; days 11-16) and were intermediate (P > 0.05) during the preovulatory phase (707 +/- 85 micrograms/g; days 17-21). Concentrations of IGF-I and FSH in the anterior pituitary and serum did not differ (P > 0.05) by stage of the estrous cycle. A positive correlation among the different IGFBPs in the pituitary (P < 0.01) and between each pituitary IGFBP and serum P4 (P < 0.05) existed. The significance (P < 0.0002) of the correlation between pituitary IGFBP-3 and P4 was greater (P < 0.02) than that between the other pituitary IGFBPs and P4. In summary, IGFBP activity in the anterior pituitary, but not that in serum, changed with stage of the estrous cycle in association with serum concentrations of P4. The absence of similar changes in serum or anterior pituitary concentrations of IGF-I supports the hypothesis that IGFBPs may regulate the actions of IGF-I on gonadotropin release from the anterior pituitary gland during the estrous cycle of beef cattle.

Experimental and bioinformatic analysis of cultured Bovine Endometrial Cells (BEND) responding to interferon tau (IFNT). In ruminants, embryo implantation depends on progesterone (P4) and interferon tau (IFNT) controlling endometrial function. IFNT antagonizes bovine endometrial cells (BEND) response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) through posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. We have previously described microRNAs (miRNAs) profiles in bovine endometrium, detecting miR-106a, relevant for embryo maternal communication. In this study, we investigated the expression miR-106a and genes for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), phospholipase A2, group IVA (PLA2G4A), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) in response to IFNT in BEND cells and searched for interferon responsive factors (IRFs) binding sites in their promoter genomic regions. The aim of this study was to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in IFNT signalling and its regulation of miR-106a. PTGS2 showed increased expression under PDBU, which was antagonized by IFNT. IFNT induced expression of PR and miR-106a and downregulation of ESR1 and PR. Bioinformatic analyses detected that PLA2G4A was associated to IRF-1 and IRF-6, while ESR1, PR and PTGS2 were associated to only IRF-6. All genes exhibit one motif per IRF, except miR-106a that had three binding sites for IRF-6. We report the IFNT regulatory effect on miR-106a expression through IRF-6 in bovine endometrial cells. We identified a set of potential binding sites for IRF-1 and IRF-6 within the bovine genome. A set of candidate gene regions could be characterized where IFNT can act via IRFs to regulate the expression of proteins and miRNAs. Future studies will use these data to detect new IFNT regulatory mechanisms in the endometrium.

Opposing actions of c-ets/PU.1 and c-myb protooncogene products in regulating the macrophage-specific promoters of the human and mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) genes. The receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1), the c-fms gene product, is a key determinant in the differentiation of monocytic phagocytes. Dissection of the human and mouse c-fms proximal promoters revealed opposing roles for nuclear protooncogenes in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. On the one hand, c-ets-1, c-ets-2, and the macrophage-specific factor PU.1, but not the ets-factor PEA3, trans-activated the c-fms proximal promoter. On the other hand c-myb repressed proximal promoter activity in macrophages and blocked the action of c-ets-1 and c-ets-2. Basal c-fms promoter activity was almost undetectable in the M1 leukaemia line, which expressed high levels of c-myb, but was activated as cells differentiated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor and expressed c-fms mRNA. The repressor function of c-myb depended on the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. We propose that ets-factors are necessary for the tissue-restricted expression of c-fms and that c-myb acts to ensure correct temporal expression of c-fms during myeloid differentiation.

Oral magnesium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension. To elucidate the effects of magnesium on high blood pressure, a 4-week study of oral magnesium supplementation (MgO 1 g/day) was conducted in 21 outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. During the study, blood pressure and intraerythrocyte sodium concentration decreased significantly, and the erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant (Kos) and intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration both increased. Serum triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Furthermore, the elevation in Kos significantly and positively correlated with both the increase in intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration and the decrease in mean blood pressure. There was a significant inverse correlation between the prestudy Kos and the decrease in mean blood pressure. In addition, when patients were divided according to their overall decrease in mean blood pressure, the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration was significantly higher in patients with a mean blood pressure decrease of more than 7 mm Hg than that of patients whose mean blood pressure decrease was less than 7 mm Hg. These results suggest that oral magnesium supplementation may lower blood pressure through the activation of a cell membrane sodium pump and may reduce serum lipid concentration. It also suggests that the lower the prestudy Kos or the higher the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration, the more effective the oral magnesium treatment is in lowering blood pressure. Therefore, we concluded that appropriate oral magnesium intake might be effective as a nonpharmacological treatment for essential hypertension.

Tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC) suppresses tumor growth and enhances chemosensitivity in human breast cancer cells. Microtubules are considered major therapeutic targets in patients with breast cancer. In spite of their essential role in biological functions including cell motility, cell division and intracellular transport, microtubules have not yet been considered as critical actors influencing tumor cell aggressivity. To evaluate the impact of microtubule mass and dynamics on the phenotype and sensitivity of breast cancer cells, we have targeted tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC), a crucial protein for the proper folding of alpha and beta tubulins into polymerization-competent tubulin heterodimers. We developed variants of human breast cancer cells with increased content of TBCC. Analysis of proliferation, cell cycle distribution and mitotic durations were assayed to investigate the influence of TBCC on the cell phenotype. In vivo growth of tumors was monitored in mice xenografted with breast cancer cells. The microtubule dynamics and the different fractions of tubulins were studied by time-lapse microscopy and lysate fractionation, respectively. In vitro sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents was studied by flow cytometry. In vivo chemosensitivity was assayed by treatment of mice implanted with tumor cells. TBCC overexpression influenced tubulin fraction distribution, with higher content of nonpolymerizable tubulins and lower content of polymerizable dimers and microtubules. Microtubule dynamicity was reduced in cells overexpressing TBCC. Cell cycle distribution was altered in cells containing larger amounts of TBCC with higher percentage of cells in G2-M phase and lower percentage in S-phase, along with slower passage into mitosis. While increased content of TBCC had little effect on cell proliferation in vitro, we observed a significant delay in tumor growth with respect to controls when TBCC overexpressing cells were implanted as xenografts in vivo. TBCC overexpressing variants displayed enhanced sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents both in vitro and in xenografts. These results underline the essential role of fine tuned regulation of tubulin content in tumor cells and the major impact of dysregulation of tubulin dimer content on tumor cell phenotype and response to chemotherapy. A better understanding of how the microtubule cytoskeleton is dysregulated in cancer cells would greatly contribute to a better understanding of tumor cell biology and characterisation of resistant phenotypes.

Adaptation to altered visual-vestibular feedback: mechanisms of maintenance and recovery. Adaptation of perceived movement during head motion (apparent concomitant motion, ACM) and the subsequent elimination of adaptation were studied in two experiments. During the adaptation phase of both experiments, subjects performed voluntary 1-Hz head oscillations for 6 min while fixating a stimulus moving either in the same (with) direction as or the opposite (against) direction of head movements. In Experiment 1, ACM adaptation was measured following either a 1- or a 4-min delay after the adaptation phase. Results indicated some loss of adaptation during the additional 3-min delay, demonstrating a tendency of the system linking head and image to return to its preadaptation state following removal of an adaptation stimulus. In Experiment 2, subjects viewed a stimulus after adaptation that appeared to move minimally in the same manner as the adaptation stimulus during 3 min of head oscillations. No loss of adaptation was measured in these subjects between the beginning and the end of the 3-min interval. In another condition, subjects viewed a stimulus that appeared to move alternately in the same direction as and in the opposite direction of the adaptation stimulus during a similar 3-min interval following adaptation. ACM adaptation was substantially reduced during this 3-min interval. These results implicate two mechanisms that operate to either maintain or eliminate the short-term adaptation. One is passive and operates in the absence of visual feedback to eliminate the short-term adapted state, and the other responds to postadaptation visual feedback.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human, can be proposed through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, which are known to promote stemness and tumorigenicity.
2. **IGFBP3 as a mediator of temozolomide resistance**: The second abstract shows that quiescent glioblastoma cells, which are more resistant to temozolomide, have increased expression of IGFBP3. IGFBP3 is a protein that binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and regulates their activity. Elevated IGFBP3 levels may contribute to temozolomide resistance by promoting cell survival and stemness.
3. **IRF1 regulation of IGFBP3**: The sixth abstract mentions that IRF1, a transcription factor, regulates the expression of IGFBP3 in bovine endometrial cells. IRF1 binding sites are found in the promoter region of the IGFBP3 gene, suggesting that IRF1 may directly regulate IGFBP3 expression.
4. **IRF1 as a tumor suppressor**: IRF1 is known to have tumor-suppressive functions, and its expression is often downregulated in cancer cells. The eighth abstract shows that IRF1 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation, including the c-fms gene, which is involved in macrophage differentiation.
5. **Indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1**: Based on these findings, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 can be proposed. Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells may be associated with increased expression of IGFBP3, which is regulated by IRF1. Downregulation of IRF1 in cancer cells may contribute to increased IGFBP3 expression, promoting temozolomide resistance. Therefore, IRF1 may play a role in regulating the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide, albeit indirectly through its regulation of IGFBP3.

In summary, the proposed indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 involves the following steps:

Temozolomide resistance → Increased IGFBP3 expression → IRF1 regulation of IGFBP3 → IRF1 tumor-suppressive functions

This narrative highlights the complex interplay between various molecular entities and processes involved in cancer biology and suggests that IRF1 may play a role in regulating the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide.

Recurrent Glioblastomas Exhibit Higher Expression of Biomarkers with Stem-like Properties. Despite advances in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the prognosis of patients continues to remain dismal. This unfavorable prognosis is mainly attributed to the tumor's propensity for progression and recurrence, which in turn is due to the highly aggressive nature of the persisting GBM cells that actively egress from the main tumor mass into the surrounding normal brain tissue. Such a recurrent tumor described to have a more malignant potential is highly invasive and resistant to current therapies, probably due to increased stemness and preferential selection of therapy-resistant clones of tumor cells. However, there is a paucity of literature on the expression of biomarkers in the recurrent GBM tumors that could have a role in conferring this aggressiveness. To identify the differences in the expression pattern of selected biomarkers in paired tissue samples of GBM. A retrospective study on 30 paired samples of GBM (newly diagnosed/primary and recurrent) archived in the Department of Neuropathology, NIMHANS (2006-2009), was carried out. After obtaining clinical and demographic details, tumors were characterized histomorphologically and immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with reference to expression of biomarkers such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and topoisomerase 2 A (Top2A). The results were statistically analyzed. It was observed that while p53 and IGFBP-3 expression remained unaltered in paired samples, a significant increase in the expression of EGFR (P < 0.01) was noted in the recurrent tumors. Among the other biomarkers, SOX2 expression was higher in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary tumors (P < 0.01). Conversely, the expression of Top2A was reduced in recurrent tumors (P = 0.05). Mild elevation in the expression of IGFBP-3 was observed in recurrent tumors but was not statistically significant. A significant increase in the expression of SOX2 in recurrent tumors probably indicates the presence of undifferentiated cells with stem-like properties in these tumors. EGFR is known to mediate SOX2 expression thereby resulting in stemness of the glioma cancer cells, which could further explain its overexpression in recurrent GBMs. Furthermore, a decreased expression of TOP2A observed in the recurrent tumors could probably be due to reduction in chemosensitivity to temozolomide, which has been shown in earlier studies. We also noted that p53 expression remained unaltered in the recurrent tumors when compared to the primary, suggesting the absence of preferential clonal expansion of p53 mutant cells following exposure to radiochemotherapy. Our study reiterates the fact that GBM recurrences are associated with molecular alterations that probably contribute to radiochemoresistance, increased invasiveness, therapeutic efficacy, and stemness.

Cell quiescence correlates with enhanced glioblastoma cell invasion and cytotoxic resistance. Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cells exhibit drug resistance and are highly infiltrative. GBM stem cells (GSCs), which have low proliferative capacity are thought to be one of the sources of resistant cells which result in relapse/recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating quiescent-specific tumor cell biology are not well understood. Using human GBM cell lines and patient-derived GBM cells, Oregon Green dye retention was used to identify and isolate the slow-cycling, quiescent-like cell subpopulation from the more proliferative cells in culture. Sensitivity of cell subpopulations to temozolomide and radiation, as well as the migration and invasive potential were measured. Differential expression analysis following RNAseq identified genes enriched in the quiescent cell subpopulation. Orthotopic transplantation of cells into mice was used to compare the in vivo malignancy and invasive capacity of the cells. Proliferative quiescence correlated with better TMZ resistance and enhanced cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo. RNAseq expression analysis identified genes involved in the regulation cell invasion/migration and a three-gene signature, TGFBI, IGFBP3, CHI3L1, overexpressed in quiescent cells which correlates with poor GBM patient survival.

Paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells induce senescence and differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) displays high resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, due to the presence of a fraction of GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs), which are thus representing the target for GBM elimination. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display high tumor tropism, we examined possible antitumor effects of the secreted factors from human MSCs on four GSLC lines (NCH421k, NCH644, NIB26, and NIB50). We found that conditioned media from bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (MSC-CM) mediated cell cycle arrest of GSLCs by downregulating cyclin D1. PCR arrays revealed significantly deregulated expression of 13 genes associated with senescence in NCH421k cells exposed to MSC-CM. Among these, ATM, CD44, COL1A1, MORC3, NOX4, CDKN1A, IGFBP5, and SERPINE1 genes were upregulated, whereas IGFBP3, CDKN2A, CITED2, FN1, and PRKCD genes were found to be downregulated. Pathway analyses in GO and KEGG revealed their association with p53 signaling, which can trigger senescence via cell cycle inhibitors p21 or p16. For both, upregulated expression was proven in all four GSLC lines exhibiting senescence after MSC-CM exposure. Moreover, MSC paracrine signals were shown to increase the sensitivity of NCH421k and NCH644 cells toward temozolomide, possibly by altering them toward more differentiated cell types, as evidenced by vimentin and GFAP upregulation, and Sox-2 and Notch-1 downregulation. Our findings support the notion that MSCs posses an intrinsic ability to inhibit cell cycle and induce senescence and differentiation of GSLCs.

Dissection of the Fgf8 regulatory landscape by in vivo CRISPR-editing reveals extensive intra- and inter-enhancer redundancy. Developmental genes are often regulated by multiple elements with overlapping activity. Yet, in most cases, the relative function of those elements and their contribution to endogenous gene expression remain poorly characterized. An example of this phenomenon is that distinct sets of enhancers have been proposed to direct Fgf8 in the limb apical ectodermal ridge and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Using in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we functionally dissect this complex regulatory ensemble and demonstrate two distinct regulatory logics. In the apical ectodermal ridge, the control of Fgf8 expression appears distributed between different enhancers. In contrast, we find that in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, one of the three active enhancers is essential while the other two are dispensable. We further dissect the essential midbrain-hindbrain boundary enhancer to reveal that it is also composed by a mixture of essential and dispensable modules. Cross-species transgenic analysis of this enhancer suggests that its composition may have changed in the vertebrate lineage.

beta-caryophyllene and beta-caryophyllene oxide-natural compounds of anticancer and analgesic properties. Natural bicyclic sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene (BCP) and beta-caryophyllene oxide (BCPO), are present in a large number of plants worldwide. Both BCP and BCPO (BCP(O)) possess significant anticancer activities, affecting growth and proliferation of numerous cancer cells. Nevertheless, their antineoplastic effects have hardly been investigated in vivo. In addition, both compounds potentiate the classical drug efficacy by augmenting their concentrations inside the cells. The mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of these sesquiterpenes are poorly described. BCP is a phytocannabinoid with strong affinity to cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2 ), but not cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ). In opposite, BCP oxidation derivative, BCPO, does not exhibit CB1/2 binding, thus the mechanism of its action is not related to endocannabinoid system (ECS) machinery. It is known that BCPO alters several key pathways for cancer development, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and STAT3 pathways. In addition, treatment with this compound reduces the expression of procancer genes/proteins, while increases the levels of those with proapoptotic properties. The selective activation of CB2 may be considered a novel strategy in pain treatment, devoid of psychoactive side effects associated with CB1 stimulation. Thus, BCP as selective CB2 activator may be taken into account as potential natural analgesic drug. Moreover, due to the fact that chronic pain is often an element of cancer disease, the double activity of BCP, anticancer and analgesic, as well as its beneficial influence on the efficacy of classical chemotherapeutics, is particularly valuable in oncology. This review is focused on anticancer and analgesic activities of BCP and BCPO, the mechanisms of their actions, and potential therapeutic utility.

Identification of genes regulated by leukemia-inhibitory factor in the mouse uterus at the time of implantation. The endometrium is prepared for implantation by the actions of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). In mice the luminal epithelium (LE) only becomes fully receptive to the attaching blastocyst in response to the nidatory estrogen surge on d 4 of pregnancy. The cytokine leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) is rapidly induced by nidatory estrogen and has been shown to be the primary mediator of its action. Implantation fails in the absence of LIF, and injection of LIF on d 4 of pregnancy can substitute for the nidatory estrogen. In this study, we sought to identify genes regulated by LIF in the uterine epithelium. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the transcript profiles of paired uterine horns from LIF-deficient MF1 mice after intraluminal injection of LIF or PBS on d 4 of pseudopregnancy. IGF-binding protein 3 was identified as a gene up-regulated by LIF; this was confirmed by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization showed that the primary site of IGF-binding protein 3 expression is the luminal epithelium (LE), the known site of LIF action in the uterus. We identified two other genes: amphiregulin and immune response gene-1, the expression of which were also up-regulated by LIF. Immune response gene 1 has recently been shown to be essential for implantation. Expression of all three of these genes in the LE is known to be regulated by P4. The expression of osteoblast-specific factor 2 and leukocyte 12/15 lipoxygenase, which are also expressed in LE under the control of P4, were not increased by LIF. This suggests that one of the actions of LIF on LE may be to enhance the expression of a subset of P4-regulated genes.

GH regulates secretory activity and apoptosis in cultured bovine granulosa cells through the activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A system. We have studied the action of GH on the production of hormones, growth factors, growth factor-binding protein and the occurrence of apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells, as well as the role of cAMP-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) in the mediation of these effects. For this purpose we investigated the effects of exogenous bovine GH (0.001-10 microgram/ml), PKA blockers KT5720 (100 ng/ml) and adenosine-3',5'-monophosphothiodate (Rp-cAMPS) (1 micromol), alone and in combination, on IGF-I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, oxytocin, progesterone and estradiol secretion, cAMP and PKA content and the occurrence of apoptosis. The secretion of hormones, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 into the culture medium was measured using RIA/IRMA. The presence of PKA was detected using immunocytochemistry and Western immunoblotting. The presence of cAMP in cells was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry, whilst the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by the TUNEL method. It was found that the addition of GH to the culture medium strongly (P<0.05) stimulated IGF-I (at a concentration of 0.001-10 microgram GH/ml medium), IGFBP-3 (0.001-1 microgram GH/ml) and oxytocin (0.01-10 microgram GH/ml) secretion. Low concentrations (1-100 ng/ml) of GH stimulated, whilst a higher concentration (10 microgram/ml) inhibited estradiol output. GH slightly (P<0.05) inhibited progesterone (1-100 ng GH/ml) secretion and significantly (P<0.05) decreased the incidence of apoptosis (0.01-1 microgram GH/ml) in cultured cells. The addition of GH (100 ng/ml) caused a dramatic (P<0.05) increase in the proportion of cells possessing the immunoreactive catalytic subunit of PKA and a slight decrease in the proportion of cells containing the regulatory PKA subunit.PKA blockers KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS significantly (P<0.05) reduced the proportion of granulosa cells containing cAMP, and the catalytic and (in the case of KT5720) regulatory subunits of PKA. KT5720 given alone significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the secretion of IGFBP-3, but not that of IGF-I or progesterone. Rp-cAMPS decreased (P<0.05) the secretion of oxytocin but not that of estradiol output or the occurrence of apoptosis. KT5720 and Rp-cAMPS fully or partially prevented the GH effect on IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol and apoptosis. These observations suggest the involvement of GH and a cAMP/PKA-dependent intracellular cascade in the control of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, progesterone, estradiol, cAMP and apoptosis in bovine ovarian granulosa cells. The stimulation of PKA by GH and the prevention of GH-induced effects by PKA blockers suggest that the observed GH effects on bovine ovarian cells are probably mediated by the cAMP/PKA system.

Histochemical localization of endometrial insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 and -3 during the luteal phase in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles: a controlled study. To determine if controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) affects the endometrial expression of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3. Prospective, controlled study. Tertiary infertility clinic. Eighteen oocyte donors undergoing COH cycles and 17 natural cycle controls. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, endometrial biopsies. Immunohistochemical scoring of endometrial IGFBP-1 and -3 expression, morphological endometrial dating, and serum estradiol (E(2)), LH, and progesterone (P(4)) concentrations. No statistically significant difference was observed between natural and stimulated cycles in change in IGFBP-1 or -3 over standardized cycle days throughout the window of embryo implantation (days 17-24). The IGFBP-1 and -3 expression was zero or near zero for both the natural and COH cycles until day 12-13. Both IGFBPs showed increased production throughout the secretory phase. Advanced endometrial histology (>/=1 day) in glands and stroma was noted in COH cycles. Significant positive correlations of E(2) and P(4) were noted with IGFBP-1 and -3 but not with advanced endometrial morphology in the COH cycles. The COH cycles have no significantly increased endometrial IGFBP-1 or -3 expression throughout the implantation phase of the luteal cycle compared with normal menstrual cycles. Both IGFBPs were absent in the proliferative phase and increased throughout the secretory portion of the embryo implantation window.

Expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins during development of porcine ovarian follicles. We examined the expression of the mRNAs for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and two of their binding proteins (BPs), IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, in individual follicles of the porcine ovary. Follicular development was synchronized with a progestin (altrenogest). Individual follicles were isolated on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after progestin withdrawal. No IGFBP-3 mRNA was detected. While IGF-II mRNA was easily detected, the levels of expression did not change. IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs increased and decreased, respectively, with follicle development until day 7 when IGF-I expression declined. Regression analysis of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was performed to assess the relative strength of correlations with day, diameter and steroid concentrations as covariates. IGFBP-2 mRNA was correlated with both day and diameter (r = -.713 and -.705, respectively, n = 24) and neither estrogen (E2) nor progesterone (P4) contributed to the fit. While IGF-I mRNA expression was correlated to both day (r = .483) and diameter (r = .587), the strongest predictor was E2 concentration (r = .694, n = 27). In conclusion, the expression of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 mRNAs in the ovarian follicle are discordantly regulated during follicular growth and maturation. The observed changes in these parameters should result in increased bioavailable IGF-I. This supports a pivotal autocrine/paracrine role for these factors during follicle growth and development.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins in bovine sera and pituitaries at different stages of the estrous cycle. The objective of this study was to determine whether concentrations of hypophyseal and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and binding activities of serum and hypophyseal IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) differ with stage of the estrous cycle in mature beef cows. Cows were assigned to the following stages of the estrous cycle based on serum concentrations of progesterone (P4) and ovarian structures at death: days 1-5 (day 0 = estrus; n = 18), days 6-10 (n = 24), days 11-16 (n = 39), and days 17-21 (n = 7). Serum samples collected at death and anterior pituitary homogenates were analyzed for IGF-I, LH, and FSH by RIA. Serum and pituitary IGFBPs were evaluated by ligand and immunoblot analyses. Serum samples contained IGFBP activity at 44 and 40 kilodaltons (kDa; IGFBP-3), 34 kDa (IGFBP-2), 30 kDa (IGFBP-5), 28 kDa, and 24 kDa. The intensity of binding by the different sized proteins in serum remained constant throughout the estrous cycle. IGFBPs detected in anterior pituitaries included a 36-/40-kDa doublet (IGFBP-3), a 32-kDa protein (IGFBP-2), and a 29-kDa IGFBP (IGFBP-5). The intensity of [125I]IGF-I binding to IGFBPs was greater (P < 0.05) during days 11-16 than days 1-5 or days 6-10 of the estrous cycle and was intermediate (P > 0.05) during days 17-21. Serum concentrations of LH were low (< 0.4 ng/ml) during days 1-16 of the estrous cycle, but increased (P < 0.05) approximately 3- to 4-fold during days 17-21. LH concentrations in the anterior pituitary increased (P < 0.05) from the postovulatory period (548 +/- 52 micrograms/g; days 1-5) to the late luteal phase (791 +/- 39 micrograms/g; days 11-16) and were intermediate (P > 0.05) during the preovulatory phase (707 +/- 85 micrograms/g; days 17-21). Concentrations of IGF-I and FSH in the anterior pituitary and serum did not differ (P > 0.05) by stage of the estrous cycle. A positive correlation among the different IGFBPs in the pituitary (P < 0.01) and between each pituitary IGFBP and serum P4 (P < 0.05) existed. The significance (P < 0.0002) of the correlation between pituitary IGFBP-3 and P4 was greater (P < 0.02) than that between the other pituitary IGFBPs and P4. In summary, IGFBP activity in the anterior pituitary, but not that in serum, changed with stage of the estrous cycle in association with serum concentrations of P4. The absence of similar changes in serum or anterior pituitary concentrations of IGF-I supports the hypothesis that IGFBPs may regulate the actions of IGF-I on gonadotropin release from the anterior pituitary gland during the estrous cycle of beef cattle.

Experimental and bioinformatic analysis of cultured Bovine Endometrial Cells (BEND) responding to interferon tau (IFNT). In ruminants, embryo implantation depends on progesterone (P4) and interferon tau (IFNT) controlling endometrial function. IFNT antagonizes bovine endometrial cells (BEND) response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) through posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. We have previously described microRNAs (miRNAs) profiles in bovine endometrium, detecting miR-106a, relevant for embryo maternal communication. In this study, we investigated the expression miR-106a and genes for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), phospholipase A2, group IVA (PLA2G4A), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) in response to IFNT in BEND cells and searched for interferon responsive factors (IRFs) binding sites in their promoter genomic regions. The aim of this study was to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in IFNT signalling and its regulation of miR-106a. PTGS2 showed increased expression under PDBU, which was antagonized by IFNT. IFNT induced expression of PR and miR-106a and downregulation of ESR1 and PR. Bioinformatic analyses detected that PLA2G4A was associated to IRF-1 and IRF-6, while ESR1, PR and PTGS2 were associated to only IRF-6. All genes exhibit one motif per IRF, except miR-106a that had three binding sites for IRF-6. We report the IFNT regulatory effect on miR-106a expression through IRF-6 in bovine endometrial cells. We identified a set of potential binding sites for IRF-1 and IRF-6 within the bovine genome. A set of candidate gene regions could be characterized where IFNT can act via IRFs to regulate the expression of proteins and miRNAs. Future studies will use these data to detect new IFNT regulatory mechanisms in the endometrium.

Opposing actions of c-ets/PU.1 and c-myb protooncogene products in regulating the macrophage-specific promoters of the human and mouse colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) genes. The receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1), the c-fms gene product, is a key determinant in the differentiation of monocytic phagocytes. Dissection of the human and mouse c-fms proximal promoters revealed opposing roles for nuclear protooncogenes in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. On the one hand, c-ets-1, c-ets-2, and the macrophage-specific factor PU.1, but not the ets-factor PEA3, trans-activated the c-fms proximal promoter. On the other hand c-myb repressed proximal promoter activity in macrophages and blocked the action of c-ets-1 and c-ets-2. Basal c-fms promoter activity was almost undetectable in the M1 leukaemia line, which expressed high levels of c-myb, but was activated as cells differentiated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor and expressed c-fms mRNA. The repressor function of c-myb depended on the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. We propose that ets-factors are necessary for the tissue-restricted expression of c-fms and that c-myb acts to ensure correct temporal expression of c-fms during myeloid differentiation.

Oral magnesium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension. To elucidate the effects of magnesium on high blood pressure, a 4-week study of oral magnesium supplementation (MgO 1 g/day) was conducted in 21 outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. During the study, blood pressure and intraerythrocyte sodium concentration decreased significantly, and the erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant (Kos) and intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration both increased. Serum triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Furthermore, the elevation in Kos significantly and positively correlated with both the increase in intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration and the decrease in mean blood pressure. There was a significant inverse correlation between the prestudy Kos and the decrease in mean blood pressure. In addition, when patients were divided according to their overall decrease in mean blood pressure, the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration was significantly higher in patients with a mean blood pressure decrease of more than 7 mm Hg than that of patients whose mean blood pressure decrease was less than 7 mm Hg. These results suggest that oral magnesium supplementation may lower blood pressure through the activation of a cell membrane sodium pump and may reduce serum lipid concentration. It also suggests that the lower the prestudy Kos or the higher the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration, the more effective the oral magnesium treatment is in lowering blood pressure. Therefore, we concluded that appropriate oral magnesium intake might be effective as a nonpharmacological treatment for essential hypertension.

Tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC) suppresses tumor growth and enhances chemosensitivity in human breast cancer cells. Microtubules are considered major therapeutic targets in patients with breast cancer. In spite of their essential role in biological functions including cell motility, cell division and intracellular transport, microtubules have not yet been considered as critical actors influencing tumor cell aggressivity. To evaluate the impact of microtubule mass and dynamics on the phenotype and sensitivity of breast cancer cells, we have targeted tubulin binding cofactor C (TBCC), a crucial protein for the proper folding of alpha and beta tubulins into polymerization-competent tubulin heterodimers. We developed variants of human breast cancer cells with increased content of TBCC. Analysis of proliferation, cell cycle distribution and mitotic durations were assayed to investigate the influence of TBCC on the cell phenotype. In vivo growth of tumors was monitored in mice xenografted with breast cancer cells. The microtubule dynamics and the different fractions of tubulins were studied by time-lapse microscopy and lysate fractionation, respectively. In vitro sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents was studied by flow cytometry. In vivo chemosensitivity was assayed by treatment of mice implanted with tumor cells. TBCC overexpression influenced tubulin fraction distribution, with higher content of nonpolymerizable tubulins and lower content of polymerizable dimers and microtubules. Microtubule dynamicity was reduced in cells overexpressing TBCC. Cell cycle distribution was altered in cells containing larger amounts of TBCC with higher percentage of cells in G2-M phase and lower percentage in S-phase, along with slower passage into mitosis. While increased content of TBCC had little effect on cell proliferation in vitro, we observed a significant delay in tumor growth with respect to controls when TBCC overexpressing cells were implanted as xenografts in vivo. TBCC overexpressing variants displayed enhanced sensitivity to antimicrotubule agents both in vitro and in xenografts. These results underline the essential role of fine tuned regulation of tubulin content in tumor cells and the major impact of dysregulation of tubulin dimer content on tumor cell phenotype and response to chemotherapy. A better understanding of how the microtubule cytoskeleton is dysregulated in cancer cells would greatly contribute to a better understanding of tumor cell biology and characterisation of resistant phenotypes.

Age differences in the speed and capacity of information processing: 1. A dual-task approach. Sixty subjects, spanning the age range from 20 to 65, performed a series of tasks designed to evaluate the effects of aging on the speed and capacity of the human information-processing system. A tracking task was performed alone and concurrently with different versions of a Sternberg memory search task that varied the degree of resource competition with the tracking task. A dichotic-listening task, a tracking-task measure of perceptual-motor speed, and a complex transcription task were also performed. The data revealed a monotonic decrease in processing speed with age but no difference in time-sharing abilities between age groups. The latter conclusion was supported by a factor analysis of the test scores, which revealed that scores on the factor defining time-sharing did not differ with age.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells**: The first abstract mentions that recurrent glioblastomas exhibit higher expression of biomarkers with stem-like properties, which may contribute to their resistance to temozolomide. This resistance is associated with increased expression of EGFR and SOX2, which are known to promote stemness and invasiveness in glioma cells.
2. **Quiescent glioblastoma cells**: The second abstract shows that quiescent glioblastoma cells, which are characterized by low proliferative capacity, are more resistant to temozolomide and exhibit enhanced invasive potential. This suggests that quiescent cells may be a key population that contributes to temozolomide resistance.
3. **IGFBP3 expression**: The second abstract also identifies IGFBP3 as a gene that is overexpressed in quiescent glioblastoma cells. IGFBP3 is a protein that binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and regulates their activity.
4. **IRF1 regulation**: The eighth abstract mentions that IRF1, a transcription factor, regulates the expression of IGFBP3 in bovine endometrial cells. This suggests that IRF1 may also play a role in regulating IGFBP3 expression in other cell types, including glioblastoma cells.
5. **Temozolomide-induced changes in IRF1 expression**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, it is possible that temozolomide treatment may induce changes in IRF1 expression, which in turn affects IGFBP3 expression and contributes to temozolomide resistance.

In summary, the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human may involve the following sequence of events:

Temozolomide treatment → Selection of quiescent glioblastoma cells → Increased expression of IGFBP3 → Regulation of IGFBP3 by IRF1 → Modulation of IRF1 expression by temozolomide → Altered IRF1 activity → Changes in IGFBP3 expression → Temozolomide resistance

This narrative is speculative and requires further experimental validation to confirm the relationships between these entities. However, it provides a possible framework for understanding the indirect relationship between temozolomide and IRF1 protein, human.

2025-01-20 13:36:17,903 - Based on the following scientific abstracts, please describe how an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist. Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between dextroamphetamine and linezolid.

Investigations on the interaction between cyproheptadine and amphetamine. The effect of cyproheptadine (CPH) given in doses of 1.25 and 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally one hour before administration of D-(+)-amphetamine (AMPH) 5 mg/kg subcutaneously was studied. A moderate increase was observed in the intensity of amphetamine-induced stereotypy and a significant rise in the number of rearings after premedication with CPH 5 mg/kg. In pharmacokinetic investigations the serum level of AMPH was found to be decreased in the animals after CPH premedication. The biological half-time of AMPH in the blood was reduced after premedication with CPH 5 mg/kg. On the other hand, the level of amphetamine rose in the brain following premedication with CPH in both doses. These results suggest that the rise in brain AMPH level could be responsible for intensification of AMPH effects induced by CPH premedication.

The effects of putative 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor active agents on D-amphetamine self-administration in controls and rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine median forebrain bundle lesions. Animals in which 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) was bilaterally injected into the median forebrain bundle (MFB) and sham lesioned animals were allowed access to an apparatus which delivered, upon lever pressing, intravenous D-amphetamine injections. MFB lesioned rats achieved stable self-injections patterns and self-administered more drug per test session than controls. A number of agents known to either directly or indirectly affect 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor function were administered prior to D-amphetamine access. The responses to these pretreatments in lesioned vs non-lesioned rats were markedly different. Pretreatment with L-tryptophan reduced the number of D-amphetamine self-injections in sham lesioned rats but had no effect in MFB lesioned animals. Fluoxetine pretreatment, likewise, reduced responding in non-lesioned rats and had no observable effect in lesioned animals. Quipazine markedly reduced self-injection in control rats but was not evaluated in the lesioned group. The putative 5-HT antagonists utilized, cyproheptadine and methysergide, unpredictably reduced self-injection frequency of non-lesioned animals in a dose related manner. When MFB lesioned animals were pretreated with cyproheptadine, rapid bursts of lever pressing were observed and 3 of 6 animals thus treated died as a result (presumably amphetamine overdose). In the remaining animals, methysergide produced a similar marked increase in self-injection rate. While these data may suggest that, in some instances, non-serotonergic mechanisms are involved, for the most part it would appear that 5-HT containing neurons are of major import in some aspect of D-amphetamine self-administration.

Differentiaton of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine. The dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine elicit hyperthermic, hyperkinetic and stereotypic responses in the rabbit. The present investigation compares the influence exerted by various serotonergic antagonists upon these activities. Apomorphine-induced hyperthemia was antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), cyproheptadine and cinanserin and was restored in pCPA-pretreated rabbits by regeneration of central serotonin levels, d-Amphetamine-induced hyperthermia was reduced by pCPA; restored in pCPA-pretreated animals by regeneration of central serotonin levels; and was uninfluenced by cyproheptadine and cinanserin. Apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation was unaltered by serotonergic antagonists; however, these same doses of anti-serotonergic agents all markedly reduced d-amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. Serotonergic antgaonists also failed to affect apomorphine-induced compulsive gnawing but did significantly enhance d-amphetamine-induced compulsive gnawing. It is concluded from these data that the neuropharmacological activities of apopmorphine and d-amphetamine in the rabbit differ in their dependence upon central serotonergic mechanisms.

Antidepressant activities of WEB 1881, a new nootropic agent. The central action, particularly potential antidepressant activity of WEB 1881, a new nootropic drug related to piracetam, was investigated in rats and mice. WEB 1881 antagonizes the reserpine- and apomorphine-induced hypothermia, potentiates the behavioral effect of DOPA and dihydroxyphenylserine, as well as the TRH-induced hyperthermia. Piracetam was only effective in the reserpine and DOPA tests. WEB 1881 is inactive in immobility test of Porsolt et al. It enhances the hind limb flexor reflex of the spinal rat, this effect being antagonized by prazosin and cyproheptadine. It exerts no effect on head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan. The studied compound increases the noradrenaline and dopamine and turnover in the forebrain and brain stem. WEB 1881 given repeatedly potentiates the clonidine-induced aggressiveness and has no effect on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine. The results indicate that in a number of tests WEB 1881 acts like other antidepressant drugs (but in others not), moreover, they suggest that this action is--at least partly--mediated by the central noradrenaline system.

Responses of the flexor reflex to LSD, tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, methoxamine, and d-amphetamine in acute and chronic spinal rats. The flexor reflex of acute (40-48 h after mid-thoracic spinal transection) and chronic (at least 2 months after transection) spinal rats was evoked by tetanic electrical stimulation of both hindfeet and recorded on a polygraph using a transducer connected to the left hindfoot. The flexor reflex in the chronic spinal rat was more responsive to electrical stimulation and to the actions of drugs studied than was the flexor reflex in the acute spinal rat. In chronic spinal rats, d-amphetamine, methoxamine, LSD, tryptamine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) facilitated the flexor reflex and induced spontaneous movements. These facilitative effects were seen in acute spinal rats only when much larger i.p. doses of amphetamine, methoxamine, and LSD were used. Small i.v. doses of tryptamine also produced the facilitation. The facilitation caused by LSD and tryptamine, but not 5-HTP, in chronic spinal rats was antagonized by cyproheptadine. These observations suggest that chronic spinal rats were more sensitive to the drugs than acute spinal rats and support the hypothesis that the mode of action of LSD is similar to that of tryptamine but different from that of 5-HTP since cyproheptadine antagonized the facilitative effects of LSD and tryptamine but not those of 5-HTP.

Serotonin syndrome: case report and review of the literature. We present the case of a 35-year-old woman who developed serotonin syndrome after receiving a single dose of the cyclic antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil). She was already being treated for depression with paroxetine (Paxil), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Two hours after receiving imipramine, the patient developed tachycardia, delirium, bizarre movements, and myoclonus, all classic findings of serotonin syndrome. Her antidepressants were discontinued and she was treated with intravenous fluids, sedation, and a short course of cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist. All symptoms resolved completely within 24 hours. In this case report, we review the drug interactions that can precipitate serotonin syndrome, and give recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of this potentially fatal disorder.

Overview of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening toxic state caused by an adverse drug reaction that leads to excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. This excessive serotonin hyperstimulation may be secondary to 1 standard therapeutic dose of a single agent, inadvertent interactions between various drugs, intentionally or unintentionally excessive use of particular drugs, deliberate self-harm, or recreational use of certain drugs. This review article serves as an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, and prevention of SS. The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for the period covering 1955 to 2011. SS commonly occurs after the use of serotonergic agents alone or in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. SS classically consists of a triad of signs and symptoms broadly characterized as alteration of mental status, abnormalities of neuromuscular tone, and autonomic hyperactivity. However, all 3 triads of SS may not occur simultaneously. Clinical manifestations are diverse and nonspecific, which may lead to misdiagnosis. SS can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Most cases of SS are mild and resolve with prompt recognition and supportive care. Management of SS involves withdrawal of the offending agent(s), aggressive supportive care to treat hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction, and occasionally the administration of serotonin antagonists--cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine. Patients with moderate and severe cases of SS require inpatient hospitalization. Psychiatrists, clinicians, and general practitioners must develop increased awareness of SS due to the current increase in the use of serotonergic agents in clinical practice. As SS is a manifestation of adverse pharmacology, it is not considered an idiosyncratic drug reaction, making it predictable and highly preventable. Most cases of SS are mild and easily managed. With prompt recognition and supportive care, more severe cases of SS have a favorable prognosis.

Comment: serotonin syndrome, mydriasis, and cyproheptadine.

Rare case of serotonin syndrome with therapeutic doses of paroxetine. Paroxetine (Paxil) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and anxiolytic that is approved to treat numerous mood disorders. Serotonin syndrome, defined as a triad of mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities, is a potentially life-threatening complication of administering such serotonin-modifying drugs. Most cases of serotonin syndrome that have occurred with paroxetine administration are due to inadvertent drug interactions, most notably between SSRIs and monamine oxidase inhibitors, or intentional overdoses. The authors present the case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with serotonin syndrome while on a therapeutic dose of paroxetine. Paroxetine was stopped, and aggressive hydration with fluids and treatment with cyproheptadine was followed by remarkable improvement and return to baseline status in 4 days. This case illustrates the importance for physicians to have a heightened sense of suspicion of the serotonin syndrome in any patient known to be on serotonin-modifying agents presenting with altered sensorium and cholinergic symptoms. Consequently, they will be able to start timely treatment without subjecting the patient to unnecessary and potentially harmful tests.

Modulation of brainstem 5-HT1C receptors by serotonergic drugs in the rat. 1. The sparse population of brainstem 5-hydroxytryptamine1C (5-HT1C) (also called 5-HT2C) receptors has received little attention despite its possible role in the serotonin syndrome and 5-HT-mediated shaking behavior. We characterized [3H]mesulergine binding in rat brainstem and, to determine if brainstem 5-HT1C sites respond to serotonergic manipulations, performed saturation studies of [3H]mesulergine binding in brainstem from rats treated chronically with 11 different 5-HT1C/2 agonists and antagonists. 2. In competition studies in vitro, the rank order of drug potency was most compatible with a 5-HT1C receptor binding site: mianserin, 5-HT, cinanserin, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP), 1-(2-5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), MDL 100,907, RU 24969, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), 8-OH-DPAT, MDL 72,222. 3. Chronic treatment with the agonists quipazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and the antagonists ritanserin and methiothepin significantly down-regulated brainstem 5-HT1C sites, which were 65% of [3H]mesulergine-labeled sites in brainstem. Only metergoline and ritanserin significantly increased pKD. 4. Chronic treatment in vivo with DOI, m-CPP, mianserin, methysergide, spiperone, cyproheptadine, and metergoline had no significant effect on BMAX at the dose studied. 5. These data suggest similarities in the regulation of 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites at which both 5-HT1C 2 agonists and antagonists also induce receptor down-regulation. 6. 5-HT1C/2 agonists and antagonists that did not down-regulate brainstem 5-HT1C sites may be more active in vivo at 5-HT2 sites, at 5-HT1C sites in other brain regions, have effects on 5-HT1C receptors not detectable at the recognition site, or differ for pharmacokinetic reasons.

Serotonin syndrome and linezolid. We present a case of serotonin syndrome in a patient who initiated linezolid therapy shortly after discontinuation of therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine).

Linezolid-induced near-fatal serotonin syndrome during escitalopram therapy: case report and review of literature. Linezolid is a synthetic antimicrobial agent of the oxazolidinone class with weak, nonspecific inhibitor of monoamine oxidase enzymes. Concomitant therapy with an adrenergic or serotonergic agent or consuming tyramine (>100 mg/day) may induce serotonin syndrome (SS). We present a case report of near-fatal adverse interaction between linezolid and escitalopram inducing SS in a 65-year-old woman with sepsis, under empirical antibiotic treatment. This report also summarizes the current relevant literature as identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, supplemented with a manual search of cross references.

Linezolid is associated with serotonin syndrome in a patient receiving amitriptyline, and fentanyl: a case report and review of the literature. We report a unique case of an adverse interaction between the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid, the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline and the opioid analgesic fentanyl in a 68-year-old woman with advanced ischemic peripheral arterial disease and sepsis, under empirical antibiotic treatment. We also summarize the current relevant literature as identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO as well as reference sections of selected articles.

Linezolid and fentanyl: An underrecognized drug-to-drug interaction. Despite its frequent use in clinical practice, fentanyl's pro-serotonergic effects are underrecognized, especially in combination with linezolid. Life-threatening reactions can occur. We report a case of serotonin syndrome developed shortly after the initiation of linezolid in a 63-year-old patient in whom selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy was discontinued for the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, fentanyl transdermal patch treatment was inadvertently continued. Noteworthy, 24 hours following discontinuation of linezolid, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Fentanyl can increase the intrasynaptic release of serotonin through their effects on y-amino butyric acid and its phenylpiperidine chemical structure. We illustrate the importance of thorough medication reconciliation and review of all potential drug-to-drug interactions when indicating linezolid therapy to ensure patient safety. We believe that our case provides novel observations and insight that could help recognize similar cases in clinical practice.

A Case of Linezolid Toxicity Presenting as a Sepsis Mimic. Linezolid is an efficacious and well tolerated antimicrobial but can have serious adverse effects including myelo-suppression, serotonin syndrome, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and lactic acidosis. The side effects are generally duration dependent; linezolid use is not recommended for more than 28 days. Case. A 59-year-old female presented with malaise, loss of appetite, and altered mentation. She had multiple medical comorbidities and required long-term anticoagulation with warfarin for venous thromboembolism. She had multiple medication allergies. Prior to admission, she was on linezolid for cellulitis of foot due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). On physical exam, she was drowsy and required endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Initial laboratory parameters showed lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, supra-therapeutic coagulation profile, low blood glucose, and transaminitis. Her altered mentation was due to hypoglycemia. The interaction with warfarin led to altered coagulation profile. She developed shock and vasopressors were initiated. Given her presentation, she was managed as severe sepsis. There were no active infectious foci attributing to decline of her clinical status. Linezolid was discontinued and she was managed with intravenous polymyxin B, aztreonam, and vancomycin. Her hemodynamic status improved within one day. She was extubated on Day 5 of her presentation. Her laboratory parameters showed gradual improvement over 12 days after discontinuation of linezolid. Retrospective evaluation revealed linezolid toxicity as possible cause of presentation. Linezolid toxicity can present as sepsis mimic and should be considered as a differential diagnosis while managing sepsis with other antimicrobial agents.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system. Here's a possible narrative that connects the key findings and underlying mechanisms:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and serotonin**: Dextroamphetamine is known to increase the release of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, which can lead to enhanced serotonergic activity. This is evident from the abstracts that discuss the effects of dextroamphetamine on serotonin syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive serotonergic activity.
2. **Cyproheptadine and serotonin**: Cyproheptadine is a serotonin receptor antagonist that can block the effects of excessive serotonergic activity. In the abstracts, cyproheptadine is used to treat serotonin syndrome, and it is also shown to interact with dextroamphetamine, potentially modifying its effects.
3. **Linezolid and serotonin**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, is a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase enzymes, which can lead to increased levels of serotonin in the brain. This is evident from the abstracts that report cases of serotonin syndrome in patients taking linezolid, particularly when combined with other serotonergic agents.
4. **Indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid**: Given that both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can increase serotonergic activity, it is possible that their concurrent use could lead to excessive serotonin levels, potentially resulting in serotonin syndrome. Although there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, their indirect relationship is mediated by their effects on the serotonergic system.

The intermediate entities or processes involved in this indirect relationship include:

* **Serotonin (5-HT)**: The neurotransmitter that is affected by both dextroamphetamine and linezolid, leading to enhanced serotonergic activity.
* **Cyproheptadine**: A serotonin receptor antagonist that can block the effects of excessive serotonergic activity, potentially modifying the interactions between dextroamphetamine and linezolid.
* **Monoamine oxidase enzymes**: The enzymes that are inhibited by linezolid, leading to increased levels of serotonin in the brain.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is mediated by their effects on the serotonergic system, particularly through their ability to increase serotonin levels in the brain. This relationship is influenced by intermediate entities, such as cyproheptadine and monoamine oxidase enzymes, which can modify the interactions between these two substances.

The effects of putative 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor active agents on D-amphetamine self-administration in controls and rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine median forebrain bundle lesions. Animals in which 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) was bilaterally injected into the median forebrain bundle (MFB) and sham lesioned animals were allowed access to an apparatus which delivered, upon lever pressing, intravenous D-amphetamine injections. MFB lesioned rats achieved stable self-injections patterns and self-administered more drug per test session than controls. A number of agents known to either directly or indirectly affect 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor function were administered prior to D-amphetamine access. The responses to these pretreatments in lesioned vs non-lesioned rats were markedly different. Pretreatment with L-tryptophan reduced the number of D-amphetamine self-injections in sham lesioned rats but had no effect in MFB lesioned animals. Fluoxetine pretreatment, likewise, reduced responding in non-lesioned rats and had no observable effect in lesioned animals. Quipazine markedly reduced self-injection in control rats but was not evaluated in the lesioned group. The putative 5-HT antagonists utilized, cyproheptadine and methysergide, unpredictably reduced self-injection frequency of non-lesioned animals in a dose related manner. When MFB lesioned animals were pretreated with cyproheptadine, rapid bursts of lever pressing were observed and 3 of 6 animals thus treated died as a result (presumably amphetamine overdose). In the remaining animals, methysergide produced a similar marked increase in self-injection rate. While these data may suggest that, in some instances, non-serotonergic mechanisms are involved, for the most part it would appear that 5-HT containing neurons are of major import in some aspect of D-amphetamine self-administration.

Differentiaton of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine. The dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine elicit hyperthermic, hyperkinetic and stereotypic responses in the rabbit. The present investigation compares the influence exerted by various serotonergic antagonists upon these activities. Apomorphine-induced hyperthemia was antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), cyproheptadine and cinanserin and was restored in pCPA-pretreated rabbits by regeneration of central serotonin levels, d-Amphetamine-induced hyperthermia was reduced by pCPA; restored in pCPA-pretreated animals by regeneration of central serotonin levels; and was uninfluenced by cyproheptadine and cinanserin. Apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation was unaltered by serotonergic antagonists; however, these same doses of anti-serotonergic agents all markedly reduced d-amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. Serotonergic antgaonists also failed to affect apomorphine-induced compulsive gnawing but did significantly enhance d-amphetamine-induced compulsive gnawing. It is concluded from these data that the neuropharmacological activities of apopmorphine and d-amphetamine in the rabbit differ in their dependence upon central serotonergic mechanisms.

Antidepressant activities of WEB 1881, a new nootropic agent. The central action, particularly potential antidepressant activity of WEB 1881, a new nootropic drug related to piracetam, was investigated in rats and mice. WEB 1881 antagonizes the reserpine- and apomorphine-induced hypothermia, potentiates the behavioral effect of DOPA and dihydroxyphenylserine, as well as the TRH-induced hyperthermia. Piracetam was only effective in the reserpine and DOPA tests. WEB 1881 is inactive in immobility test of Porsolt et al. It enhances the hind limb flexor reflex of the spinal rat, this effect being antagonized by prazosin and cyproheptadine. It exerts no effect on head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan. The studied compound increases the noradrenaline and dopamine and turnover in the forebrain and brain stem. WEB 1881 given repeatedly potentiates the clonidine-induced aggressiveness and has no effect on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine. The results indicate that in a number of tests WEB 1881 acts like other antidepressant drugs (but in others not), moreover, they suggest that this action is--at least partly--mediated by the central noradrenaline system.

Responses of the flexor reflex to LSD, tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, methoxamine, and d-amphetamine in acute and chronic spinal rats. The flexor reflex of acute (40-48 h after mid-thoracic spinal transection) and chronic (at least 2 months after transection) spinal rats was evoked by tetanic electrical stimulation of both hindfeet and recorded on a polygraph using a transducer connected to the left hindfoot. The flexor reflex in the chronic spinal rat was more responsive to electrical stimulation and to the actions of drugs studied than was the flexor reflex in the acute spinal rat. In chronic spinal rats, d-amphetamine, methoxamine, LSD, tryptamine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) facilitated the flexor reflex and induced spontaneous movements. These facilitative effects were seen in acute spinal rats only when much larger i.p. doses of amphetamine, methoxamine, and LSD were used. Small i.v. doses of tryptamine also produced the facilitation. The facilitation caused by LSD and tryptamine, but not 5-HTP, in chronic spinal rats was antagonized by cyproheptadine. These observations suggest that chronic spinal rats were more sensitive to the drugs than acute spinal rats and support the hypothesis that the mode of action of LSD is similar to that of tryptamine but different from that of 5-HTP since cyproheptadine antagonized the facilitative effects of LSD and tryptamine but not those of 5-HTP.

Knowledge of patient's method of payment by physicians in a group practice. Physicians generally know how patients pay for their medical care. At the Marshfield Clinic, however, a group practice in Marshfield, Wis., physicians did not know the source of payment for the vast majority of their patients (79.3 percent). Also, even for the approximately one-fifth of the patients whose payment status they reported knowing, the information was incorrect for a small proportion. The patient's age and sex, length of time the physician had provided care, patient's place of employment, reason for patient's visit, and whether the physician was in the medical or surgical department apparently affected the physician's knowledge of the patient's payment status. Twenty-five of the 49 physicians studied reported they knew the payment status of none of their patients about whom they were asked; 24 knew the status of at least one patient. Only one physician in seven, however, reported having this knowledge about all the patients about whom he was asked. Physicians in medicine were more likely than those in surgical sub-specialties to know the patient's payment status. About one physician in five said such knowledge would be helpful for at least one patient; about one in seven said it would be helpful for all patients about whom they were asked. The Marshfield Clinic physicians, who receive salaries, emphasize comprehensive care and increased access to care, rather than maximization of income. The clinic offers medical care to patients in a prepayment health plan while continuing to serve other patients on a fee-for-service basis. Arrangements like this may help ease the transition to repayment if health-maintenance organizations become predominant in the delivery of health services in the United States.

Modulation of brainstem 5-HT1C receptors by serotonergic drugs in the rat. 1. The sparse population of brainstem 5-hydroxytryptamine1C (5-HT1C) (also called 5-HT2C) receptors has received little attention despite its possible role in the serotonin syndrome and 5-HT-mediated shaking behavior. We characterized [3H]mesulergine binding in rat brainstem and, to determine if brainstem 5-HT1C sites respond to serotonergic manipulations, performed saturation studies of [3H]mesulergine binding in brainstem from rats treated chronically with 11 different 5-HT1C/2 agonists and antagonists. 2. In competition studies in vitro, the rank order of drug potency was most compatible with a 5-HT1C receptor binding site: mianserin, 5-HT, cinanserin, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP), 1-(2-5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), MDL 100,907, RU 24969, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), 8-OH-DPAT, MDL 72,222. 3. Chronic treatment with the agonists quipazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and the antagonists ritanserin and methiothepin significantly down-regulated brainstem 5-HT1C sites, which were 65% of [3H]mesulergine-labeled sites in brainstem. Only metergoline and ritanserin significantly increased pKD. 4. Chronic treatment in vivo with DOI, m-CPP, mianserin, methysergide, spiperone, cyproheptadine, and metergoline had no significant effect on BMAX at the dose studied. 5. These data suggest similarities in the regulation of 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites at which both 5-HT1C 2 agonists and antagonists also induce receptor down-regulation. 6. 5-HT1C/2 agonists and antagonists that did not down-regulate brainstem 5-HT1C sites may be more active in vivo at 5-HT2 sites, at 5-HT1C sites in other brain regions, have effects on 5-HT1C receptors not detectable at the recognition site, or differ for pharmacokinetic reasons.

Serotonin syndrome and linezolid. We present a case of serotonin syndrome in a patient who initiated linezolid therapy shortly after discontinuation of therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine).

Linezolid-induced near-fatal serotonin syndrome during escitalopram therapy: case report and review of literature. Linezolid is a synthetic antimicrobial agent of the oxazolidinone class with weak, nonspecific inhibitor of monoamine oxidase enzymes. Concomitant therapy with an adrenergic or serotonergic agent or consuming tyramine (>100 mg/day) may induce serotonin syndrome (SS). We present a case report of near-fatal adverse interaction between linezolid and escitalopram inducing SS in a 65-year-old woman with sepsis, under empirical antibiotic treatment. This report also summarizes the current relevant literature as identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, supplemented with a manual search of cross references.

Linezolid is associated with serotonin syndrome in a patient receiving amitriptyline, and fentanyl: a case report and review of the literature. We report a unique case of an adverse interaction between the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid, the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline and the opioid analgesic fentanyl in a 68-year-old woman with advanced ischemic peripheral arterial disease and sepsis, under empirical antibiotic treatment. We also summarize the current relevant literature as identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO as well as reference sections of selected articles.

Linezolid and fentanyl: An underrecognized drug-to-drug interaction. Despite its frequent use in clinical practice, fentanyl's pro-serotonergic effects are underrecognized, especially in combination with linezolid. Life-threatening reactions can occur. We report a case of serotonin syndrome developed shortly after the initiation of linezolid in a 63-year-old patient in whom selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy was discontinued for the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, fentanyl transdermal patch treatment was inadvertently continued. Noteworthy, 24 hours following discontinuation of linezolid, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Fentanyl can increase the intrasynaptic release of serotonin through their effects on y-amino butyric acid and its phenylpiperidine chemical structure. We illustrate the importance of thorough medication reconciliation and review of all potential drug-to-drug interactions when indicating linezolid therapy to ensure patient safety. We believe that our case provides novel observations and insight that could help recognize similar cases in clinical practice.

A Case of Linezolid Toxicity Presenting as a Sepsis Mimic. Linezolid is an efficacious and well tolerated antimicrobial but can have serious adverse effects including myelo-suppression, serotonin syndrome, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and lactic acidosis. The side effects are generally duration dependent; linezolid use is not recommended for more than 28 days. Case. A 59-year-old female presented with malaise, loss of appetite, and altered mentation. She had multiple medical comorbidities and required long-term anticoagulation with warfarin for venous thromboembolism. She had multiple medication allergies. Prior to admission, she was on linezolid for cellulitis of foot due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). On physical exam, she was drowsy and required endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Initial laboratory parameters showed lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, supra-therapeutic coagulation profile, low blood glucose, and transaminitis. Her altered mentation was due to hypoglycemia. The interaction with warfarin led to altered coagulation profile. She developed shock and vasopressors were initiated. Given her presentation, she was managed as severe sepsis. There were no active infectious foci attributing to decline of her clinical status. Linezolid was discontinued and she was managed with intravenous polymyxin B, aztreonam, and vancomycin. Her hemodynamic status improved within one day. She was extubated on Day 5 of her presentation. Her laboratory parameters showed gradual improvement over 12 days after discontinuation of linezolid. Retrospective evaluation revealed linezolid toxicity as possible cause of presentation. Linezolid toxicity can present as sepsis mimic and should be considered as a differential diagnosis while managing sepsis with other antimicrobial agents.

An indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system. Dextroamphetamine is known to affect serotonin levels and activity in the brain, and linezolid, an antibiotic, has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, when used concomitantly with serotonergic agents.

The key findings that suggest an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid are:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on serotonin**: Studies have shown that dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release and inhibit its reuptake, leading to increased serotonergic activity in the brain.
2. **Linezolid's interaction with serotonergic agents**: Linezolid has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome when used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and other serotonergic agents.
3. **Serotonin syndrome as a common link**: Both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome, although through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonergic activity, while linezolid can inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, leading to increased serotonin levels.

The underlying mechanisms that might contribute to an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid include:

1. **Increased serotonergic activity**: Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release and inhibit its reuptake, leading to increased serotonergic activity in the brain. If linezolid is used concomitantly, it may further increase serotonin levels, potentially leading to serotonin syndrome.
2. **Inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes**: Linezolid can inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, which are responsible for breaking down serotonin. If dextroamphetamine is used concomitantly, it may increase serotonin release, and the inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes by linezolid may lead to increased serotonin levels, potentially causing serotonin syndrome.

Intermediate entities or processes that might be involved in the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid include:

1. **Cyproheptadine**: Cyproheptadine is a serotonin receptor antagonist that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome. It has been shown to interact with dextroamphetamine, reducing its self-administration in rats. Cyproheptadine may also be used to treat serotonin syndrome caused by linezolid.
2. **Serotonergic agents**: Other serotonergic agents, such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may interact with dextroamphetamine and linezolid, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system, particularly their potential to increase serotonergic activity and contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome. The use of dextroamphetamine and linezolid concomitantly may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, and caution should be exercised when prescribing these medications together.

The effects of putative 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor active agents on D-amphetamine self-administration in controls and rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine median forebrain bundle lesions. Animals in which 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) was bilaterally injected into the median forebrain bundle (MFB) and sham lesioned animals were allowed access to an apparatus which delivered, upon lever pressing, intravenous D-amphetamine injections. MFB lesioned rats achieved stable self-injections patterns and self-administered more drug per test session than controls. A number of agents known to either directly or indirectly affect 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor function were administered prior to D-amphetamine access. The responses to these pretreatments in lesioned vs non-lesioned rats were markedly different. Pretreatment with L-tryptophan reduced the number of D-amphetamine self-injections in sham lesioned rats but had no effect in MFB lesioned animals. Fluoxetine pretreatment, likewise, reduced responding in non-lesioned rats and had no observable effect in lesioned animals. Quipazine markedly reduced self-injection in control rats but was not evaluated in the lesioned group. The putative 5-HT antagonists utilized, cyproheptadine and methysergide, unpredictably reduced self-injection frequency of non-lesioned animals in a dose related manner. When MFB lesioned animals were pretreated with cyproheptadine, rapid bursts of lever pressing were observed and 3 of 6 animals thus treated died as a result (presumably amphetamine overdose). In the remaining animals, methysergide produced a similar marked increase in self-injection rate. While these data may suggest that, in some instances, non-serotonergic mechanisms are involved, for the most part it would appear that 5-HT containing neurons are of major import in some aspect of D-amphetamine self-administration.

Differentiaton of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine. The dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine elicit hyperthermic, hyperkinetic and stereotypic responses in the rabbit. The present investigation compares the influence exerted by various serotonergic antagonists upon these activities. Apomorphine-induced hyperthemia was antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), cyproheptadine and cinanserin and was restored in pCPA-pretreated rabbits by regeneration of central serotonin levels, d-Amphetamine-induced hyperthermia was reduced by pCPA; restored in pCPA-pretreated animals by regeneration of central serotonin levels; and was uninfluenced by cyproheptadine and cinanserin. Apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation was unaltered by serotonergic antagonists; however, these same doses of anti-serotonergic agents all markedly reduced d-amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. Serotonergic antgaonists also failed to affect apomorphine-induced compulsive gnawing but did significantly enhance d-amphetamine-induced compulsive gnawing. It is concluded from these data that the neuropharmacological activities of apopmorphine and d-amphetamine in the rabbit differ in their dependence upon central serotonergic mechanisms.

Antidepressant activities of WEB 1881, a new nootropic agent. The central action, particularly potential antidepressant activity of WEB 1881, a new nootropic drug related to piracetam, was investigated in rats and mice. WEB 1881 antagonizes the reserpine- and apomorphine-induced hypothermia, potentiates the behavioral effect of DOPA and dihydroxyphenylserine, as well as the TRH-induced hyperthermia. Piracetam was only effective in the reserpine and DOPA tests. WEB 1881 is inactive in immobility test of Porsolt et al. It enhances the hind limb flexor reflex of the spinal rat, this effect being antagonized by prazosin and cyproheptadine. It exerts no effect on head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan. The studied compound increases the noradrenaline and dopamine and turnover in the forebrain and brain stem. WEB 1881 given repeatedly potentiates the clonidine-induced aggressiveness and has no effect on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine. The results indicate that in a number of tests WEB 1881 acts like other antidepressant drugs (but in others not), moreover, they suggest that this action is--at least partly--mediated by the central noradrenaline system.

Responses of the flexor reflex to LSD, tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, methoxamine, and d-amphetamine in acute and chronic spinal rats. The flexor reflex of acute (40-48 h after mid-thoracic spinal transection) and chronic (at least 2 months after transection) spinal rats was evoked by tetanic electrical stimulation of both hindfeet and recorded on a polygraph using a transducer connected to the left hindfoot. The flexor reflex in the chronic spinal rat was more responsive to electrical stimulation and to the actions of drugs studied than was the flexor reflex in the acute spinal rat. In chronic spinal rats, d-amphetamine, methoxamine, LSD, tryptamine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) facilitated the flexor reflex and induced spontaneous movements. These facilitative effects were seen in acute spinal rats only when much larger i.p. doses of amphetamine, methoxamine, and LSD were used. Small i.v. doses of tryptamine also produced the facilitation. The facilitation caused by LSD and tryptamine, but not 5-HTP, in chronic spinal rats was antagonized by cyproheptadine. These observations suggest that chronic spinal rats were more sensitive to the drugs than acute spinal rats and support the hypothesis that the mode of action of LSD is similar to that of tryptamine but different from that of 5-HTP since cyproheptadine antagonized the facilitative effects of LSD and tryptamine but not those of 5-HTP.

Knowledge of patient's method of payment by physicians in a group practice. Physicians generally know how patients pay for their medical care. At the Marshfield Clinic, however, a group practice in Marshfield, Wis., physicians did not know the source of payment for the vast majority of their patients (79.3 percent). Also, even for the approximately one-fifth of the patients whose payment status they reported knowing, the information was incorrect for a small proportion. The patient's age and sex, length of time the physician had provided care, patient's place of employment, reason for patient's visit, and whether the physician was in the medical or surgical department apparently affected the physician's knowledge of the patient's payment status. Twenty-five of the 49 physicians studied reported they knew the payment status of none of their patients about whom they were asked; 24 knew the status of at least one patient. Only one physician in seven, however, reported having this knowledge about all the patients about whom he was asked. Physicians in medicine were more likely than those in surgical sub-specialties to know the patient's payment status. About one physician in five said such knowledge would be helpful for at least one patient; about one in seven said it would be helpful for all patients about whom they were asked. The Marshfield Clinic physicians, who receive salaries, emphasize comprehensive care and increased access to care, rather than maximization of income. The clinic offers medical care to patients in a prepayment health plan while continuing to serve other patients on a fee-for-service basis. Arrangements like this may help ease the transition to repayment if health-maintenance organizations become predominant in the delivery of health services in the United States.

Serotonin syndrome: case report and review of the literature. We present the case of a 35-year-old woman who developed serotonin syndrome after receiving a single dose of the cyclic antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil). She was already being treated for depression with paroxetine (Paxil), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Two hours after receiving imipramine, the patient developed tachycardia, delirium, bizarre movements, and myoclonus, all classic findings of serotonin syndrome. Her antidepressants were discontinued and she was treated with intravenous fluids, sedation, and a short course of cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist. All symptoms resolved completely within 24 hours. In this case report, we review the drug interactions that can precipitate serotonin syndrome, and give recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of this potentially fatal disorder.

Overview of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening toxic state caused by an adverse drug reaction that leads to excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. This excessive serotonin hyperstimulation may be secondary to 1 standard therapeutic dose of a single agent, inadvertent interactions between various drugs, intentionally or unintentionally excessive use of particular drugs, deliberate self-harm, or recreational use of certain drugs. This review article serves as an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, and prevention of SS. The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for the period covering 1955 to 2011. SS commonly occurs after the use of serotonergic agents alone or in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. SS classically consists of a triad of signs and symptoms broadly characterized as alteration of mental status, abnormalities of neuromuscular tone, and autonomic hyperactivity. However, all 3 triads of SS may not occur simultaneously. Clinical manifestations are diverse and nonspecific, which may lead to misdiagnosis. SS can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Most cases of SS are mild and resolve with prompt recognition and supportive care. Management of SS involves withdrawal of the offending agent(s), aggressive supportive care to treat hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction, and occasionally the administration of serotonin antagonists--cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine. Patients with moderate and severe cases of SS require inpatient hospitalization. Psychiatrists, clinicians, and general practitioners must develop increased awareness of SS due to the current increase in the use of serotonergic agents in clinical practice. As SS is a manifestation of adverse pharmacology, it is not considered an idiosyncratic drug reaction, making it predictable and highly preventable. Most cases of SS are mild and easily managed. With prompt recognition and supportive care, more severe cases of SS have a favorable prognosis.

Comment: serotonin syndrome, mydriasis, and cyproheptadine.

Rare case of serotonin syndrome with therapeutic doses of paroxetine. Paroxetine (Paxil) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and anxiolytic that is approved to treat numerous mood disorders. Serotonin syndrome, defined as a triad of mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities, is a potentially life-threatening complication of administering such serotonin-modifying drugs. Most cases of serotonin syndrome that have occurred with paroxetine administration are due to inadvertent drug interactions, most notably between SSRIs and monamine oxidase inhibitors, or intentional overdoses. The authors present the case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with serotonin syndrome while on a therapeutic dose of paroxetine. Paroxetine was stopped, and aggressive hydration with fluids and treatment with cyproheptadine was followed by remarkable improvement and return to baseline status in 4 days. This case illustrates the importance for physicians to have a heightened sense of suspicion of the serotonin syndrome in any patient known to be on serotonin-modifying agents presenting with altered sensorium and cholinergic symptoms. Consequently, they will be able to start timely treatment without subjecting the patient to unnecessary and potentially harmful tests.

Exogenous hydrogen peroxide reversibly inhibits root gravitropism and induces horizontal curvature of primary root during grass pea germination. During germination in distilled water (dH(2)O) on a horizontally positioned Petri dish, emerging primary roots of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) grew perpendicular to the bottom of the Petri dish, due to gravitropism. However, when germinated in exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), the primary roots grew parallel to the bottom of the Petri dish and asymmetrically, forming a horizontal curvature. Time-course experiments showed that the effect was strongest when H(2)O(2) was applied prior to the emergence of the primary root. H(2)O(2) failed to induce root curvature when applied post-germination. Dosage studies revealed that the frequency of primary root curvature was significantly enhanced with increased H(2)O(2) concentrations. This curvature could be directly counteracted by dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a scavenger of H(2)O(2), but not by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and pyridine, inhibitors of H(2)O(2) production. Exogenous H(2)O(2) treatment caused both an increase in the activities of H(2)O(2)-scavenging enzymes [including ascorbate peroxidase (APX: EC 1.11.1.11), catalase (CAT: EC 1.11.1.6) and peroxidase (POD: EC 1.11.1.7)] and a reduction in endogenous H(2)O(2) levels and root vitality. Although grass pea seeds absorbed exogenous H(2)O(2) during seed germination, DAB staining of paraffin sections revealed that exogenous H(2)O(2) only entered the root epidermis and not inner tissues. These data indicated that exogenously applied H(2)O(2) could lead to a reversible loss of the root gravitropic response and a horizontal curvature in primary roots during radicle emergence of the seedling.

3. **Cyproheptadine's role in treating serotonin syndrome**: Cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is often used to treat serotonin syndrome. Interestingly, cyproheptadine has also been shown to affect dextroamphetamine's behavioral effects, suggesting a potential link between the two substances.

The underlying mechanisms that might contribute to an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid are:

1. **Serotonergic system modulation**: Both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can modulate the serotonergic system, although through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine increases serotonin release and inhibits its reuptake, while linezolid can inhibit monoamine oxidase enzymes, leading to increased serotonin levels.
2. **Interactions with other serotonergic agents**: Both substances can interact with other serotonergic agents, such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and fentanyl, which can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Intermediate entities or processes that might be involved in the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid include:

1. **Serotonin receptor antagonists**: Cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, might play a role in treating serotonin syndrome caused by linezolid and could also affect dextroamphetamine's behavioral effects.
2. **Monoamine oxidase enzymes**: Linezolid's inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes could contribute to increased serotonin levels, which might interact with dextroamphetamine's effects on the serotonergic system.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system, particularly their effects on serotonin levels and activity. The use of dextroamphetamine in combination with linezolid could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, and cyproheptadine might play a role in treating this condition. However, further research is needed to fully understand the nature of this indirect relationship.

Fluoxetine pretreatment, likewise, reduced responding in non-lesioned rats and had no observable effect in lesioned animals. Quipazine markedly reduced self-injection in control rats but was not evaluated in the lesioned group. The putative 5-HT antagonists utilized, cyproheptadine and methysergide, unpredictably reduced self-injection frequency of non-lesioned animals in a dose related manner. When MFB lesioned animals were pretreated with cyproheptadine, rapid bursts of lever pressing were observed and 3 of 6 animals thus treated died as a result (presumably amphetamine overdose). In the remaining animals, methysergide produced a similar marked increase in self-injection rate. While these data may suggest that, in some instances, non-serotonergic mechanisms are involved, for the most part it would appear that 5-HT containing neurons are of major import in some aspect of D-amphetamine self-administration.

Differentiaton of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine. The dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine elicit hyperthermic, hyperkinetic and stereotypic responses in the rabbit. The present investigation compares the influence exerted by various serotonergic antagonists upon these activities. Apomorphine-induced hyperthemia was antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), cyproheptadine and cinanserin and was restored in pCPA-pretreated rabbits by regeneration of central serotonin levels, d-Amphetamine-induced hyperthermia was reduced by pCPA; restored in pCPA-pretreated animals by regeneration of central serotonin levels; and was uninfluenced by cyproheptadine and cinanserin. Apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation was unaltered by serotonergic antagonists; however, these same doses of anti-serotonergic agents all markedly reduced d-amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. Serotonergic antgaonists also failed to affect apomorphine-induced compulsive gnawing but did significantly enhance d-amphetamine-induced compulsive gnawing. It is concluded from these data that the neuropharmacological activities of apopmorphine and d-amphetamine in the rabbit differ in their dependence upon central serotonergic mechanisms.

Antidepressant activities of WEB 1881, a new nootropic agent. The central action, particularly potential antidepressant activity of WEB 1881, a new nootropic drug related to piracetam, was investigated in rats and mice. WEB 1881 antagonizes the reserpine- and apomorphine-induced hypothermia, potentiates the behavioral effect of DOPA and dihydroxyphenylserine, as well as the TRH-induced hyperthermia. Piracetam was only effective in the reserpine and DOPA tests. WEB 1881 is inactive in immobility test of Porsolt et al. It enhances the hind limb flexor reflex of the spinal rat, this effect being antagonized by prazosin and cyproheptadine. It exerts no effect on head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan. The studied compound increases the noradrenaline and dopamine and turnover in the forebrain and brain stem. WEB 1881 given repeatedly potentiates the clonidine-induced aggressiveness and has no effect on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine. The results indicate that in a number of tests WEB 1881 acts like other antidepressant drugs (but in others not), moreover, they suggest that this action is--at least partly--mediated by the central noradrenaline system.

Responses of the flexor reflex to LSD, tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, methoxamine, and d-amphetamine in acute and chronic spinal rats. The flexor reflex of acute (40-48 h after mid-thoracic spinal transection) and chronic (at least 2 months after transection) spinal rats was evoked by tetanic electrical stimulation of both hindfeet and recorded on a polygraph using a transducer connected to the left hindfoot. The flexor reflex in the chronic spinal rat was more responsive to electrical stimulation and to the actions of drugs studied than was the flexor reflex in the acute spinal rat. In chronic spinal rats, d-amphetamine, methoxamine, LSD, tryptamine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) facilitated the flexor reflex and induced spontaneous movements. These facilitative effects were seen in acute spinal rats only when much larger i.p. doses of amphetamine, methoxamine, and LSD were used. Small i.v. doses of tryptamine also produced the facilitation. The facilitation caused by LSD and tryptamine, but not 5-HTP, in chronic spinal rats was antagonized by cyproheptadine. These observations suggest that chronic spinal rats were more sensitive to the drugs than acute spinal rats and support the hypothesis that the mode of action of LSD is similar to that of tryptamine but different from that of 5-HTP since cyproheptadine antagonized the facilitative effects of LSD and tryptamine but not those of 5-HTP.

Knowledge of patient's method of payment by physicians in a group practice. Physicians generally know how patients pay for their medical care. At the Marshfield Clinic, however, a group practice in Marshfield, Wis., physicians did not know the source of payment for the vast majority of their patients (79.3 percent). Also, even for the approximately one-fifth of the patients whose payment status they reported knowing, the information was incorrect for a small proportion. The patient's age and sex, length of time the physician had provided care, patient's place of employment, reason for patient's visit, and whether the physician was in the medical or surgical department apparently affected the physician's knowledge of the patient's payment status. Twenty-five of the 49 physicians studied reported they knew the payment status of none of their patients about whom they were asked; 24 knew the status of at least one patient. Only one physician in seven, however, reported having this knowledge about all the patients about whom he was asked. Physicians in medicine were more likely than those in surgical sub-specialties to know the patient's payment status. About one physician in five said such knowledge would be helpful for at least one patient; about one in seven said it would be helpful for all patients about whom they were asked. The Marshfield Clinic physicians, who receive salaries, emphasize comprehensive care and increased access to care, rather than maximization of income. The clinic offers medical care to patients in a prepayment health plan while continuing to serve other patients on a fee-for-service basis. Arrangements like this may help ease the transition to repayment if health-maintenance organizations become predominant in the delivery of health services in the United States.

Overview of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening toxic state caused by an adverse drug reaction that leads to excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. This excessive serotonin hyperstimulation may be secondary to 1 standard therapeutic dose of a single agent, inadvertent interactions between various drugs, intentionally or unintentionally excessive use of particular drugs, deliberate self-harm, or recreational use of certain drugs. This review article serves as an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, and prevention of SS. The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for the period covering 1955 to 2011. SS commonly occurs after the use of serotonergic agents alone or in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. SS classically consists of a triad of signs and symptoms broadly characterized as alteration of mental status, abnormalities of neuromuscular tone, and autonomic hyperactivity. However, all 3 triads of SS may not occur simultaneously. Clinical manifestations are diverse and nonspecific, which may lead to misdiagnosis. SS can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Most cases of SS are mild and resolve with prompt recognition and supportive care. Management of SS involves withdrawal of the offending agent(s), aggressive supportive care to treat hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction, and occasionally the administration of serotonin antagonists--cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine. Patients with moderate and severe cases of SS require inpatient hospitalization. Psychiatrists, clinicians, and general practitioners must develop increased awareness of SS due to the current increase in the use of serotonergic agents in clinical practice. As SS is a manifestation of adverse pharmacology, it is not considered an idiosyncratic drug reaction, making it predictable and highly preventable. Most cases of SS are mild and easily managed. With prompt recognition and supportive care, more severe cases of SS have a favorable prognosis.

Comment: serotonin syndrome, mydriasis, and cyproheptadine.

Rare case of serotonin syndrome with therapeutic doses of paroxetine. Paroxetine (Paxil) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and anxiolytic that is approved to treat numerous mood disorders. Serotonin syndrome, defined as a triad of mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities, is a potentially life-threatening complication of administering such serotonin-modifying drugs. Most cases of serotonin syndrome that have occurred with paroxetine administration are due to inadvertent drug interactions, most notably between SSRIs and monamine oxidase inhibitors, or intentional overdoses. The authors present the case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with serotonin syndrome while on a therapeutic dose of paroxetine. Paroxetine was stopped, and aggressive hydration with fluids and treatment with cyproheptadine was followed by remarkable improvement and return to baseline status in 4 days. This case illustrates the importance for physicians to have a heightened sense of suspicion of the serotonin syndrome in any patient known to be on serotonin-modifying agents presenting with altered sensorium and cholinergic symptoms. Consequently, they will be able to start timely treatment without subjecting the patient to unnecessary and potentially harmful tests.

Exogenous hydrogen peroxide reversibly inhibits root gravitropism and induces horizontal curvature of primary root during grass pea germination. During germination in distilled water (dH(2)O) on a horizontally positioned Petri dish, emerging primary roots of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) grew perpendicular to the bottom of the Petri dish, due to gravitropism. However, when germinated in exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), the primary roots grew parallel to the bottom of the Petri dish and asymmetrically, forming a horizontal curvature. Time-course experiments showed that the effect was strongest when H(2)O(2) was applied prior to the emergence of the primary root. H(2)O(2) failed to induce root curvature when applied post-germination. Dosage studies revealed that the frequency of primary root curvature was significantly enhanced with increased H(2)O(2) concentrations. This curvature could be directly counteracted by dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a scavenger of H(2)O(2), but not by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and pyridine, inhibitors of H(2)O(2) production. Exogenous H(2)O(2) treatment caused both an increase in the activities of H(2)O(2)-scavenging enzymes [including ascorbate peroxidase (APX: EC 1.11.1.11), catalase (CAT: EC 1.11.1.6) and peroxidase (POD: EC 1.11.1.7)] and a reduction in endogenous H(2)O(2) levels and root vitality. Although grass pea seeds absorbed exogenous H(2)O(2) during seed germination, DAB staining of paraffin sections revealed that exogenous H(2)O(2) only entered the root epidermis and not inner tissues. These data indicated that exogenously applied H(2)O(2) could lead to a reversible loss of the root gravitropic response and a horizontal curvature in primary roots during radicle emergence of the seedling.

"Where have all the flowers gone?".

Serotonin syndrome and linezolid. We present a case of serotonin syndrome in a patient who initiated linezolid therapy shortly after discontinuation of therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine).

Linezolid-induced near-fatal serotonin syndrome during escitalopram therapy: case report and review of literature. Linezolid is a synthetic antimicrobial agent of the oxazolidinone class with weak, nonspecific inhibitor of monoamine oxidase enzymes. Concomitant therapy with an adrenergic or serotonergic agent or consuming tyramine (>100 mg/day) may induce serotonin syndrome (SS). We present a case report of near-fatal adverse interaction between linezolid and escitalopram inducing SS in a 65-year-old woman with sepsis, under empirical antibiotic treatment. This report also summarizes the current relevant literature as identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, supplemented with a manual search of cross references.

Linezolid is associated with serotonin syndrome in a patient receiving amitriptyline, and fentanyl: a case report and review of the literature. We report a unique case of an adverse interaction between the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid, the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline and the opioid analgesic fentanyl in a 68-year-old woman with advanced ischemic peripheral arterial disease and sepsis, under empirical antibiotic treatment. We also summarize the current relevant literature as identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO as well as reference sections of selected articles.

Linezolid and fentanyl: An underrecognized drug-to-drug interaction. Despite its frequent use in clinical practice, fentanyl's pro-serotonergic effects are underrecognized, especially in combination with linezolid. Life-threatening reactions can occur. We report a case of serotonin syndrome developed shortly after the initiation of linezolid in a 63-year-old patient in whom selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy was discontinued for the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, fentanyl transdermal patch treatment was inadvertently continued. Noteworthy, 24 hours following discontinuation of linezolid, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Fentanyl can increase the intrasynaptic release of serotonin through their effects on y-amino butyric acid and its phenylpiperidine chemical structure. We illustrate the importance of thorough medication reconciliation and review of all potential drug-to-drug interactions when indicating linezolid therapy to ensure patient safety. We believe that our case provides novel observations and insight that could help recognize similar cases in clinical practice.

A Case of Linezolid Toxicity Presenting as a Sepsis Mimic. Linezolid is an efficacious and well tolerated antimicrobial but can have serious adverse effects including myelo-suppression, serotonin syndrome, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and lactic acidosis. The side effects are generally duration dependent; linezolid use is not recommended for more than 28 days. Case. A 59-year-old female presented with malaise, loss of appetite, and altered mentation. She had multiple medical comorbidities and required long-term anticoagulation with warfarin for venous thromboembolism. She had multiple medication allergies. Prior to admission, she was on linezolid for cellulitis of foot due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). On physical exam, she was drowsy and required endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Initial laboratory parameters showed lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, supra-therapeutic coagulation profile, low blood glucose, and transaminitis. Her altered mentation was due to hypoglycemia. The interaction with warfarin led to altered coagulation profile. She developed shock and vasopressors were initiated. Given her presentation, she was managed as severe sepsis. There were no active infectious foci attributing to decline of her clinical status. Linezolid was discontinued and she was managed with intravenous polymyxin B, aztreonam, and vancomycin. Her hemodynamic status improved within one day. She was extubated on Day 5 of her presentation. Her laboratory parameters showed gradual improvement over 12 days after discontinuation of linezolid. Retrospective evaluation revealed linezolid toxicity as possible cause of presentation. Linezolid toxicity can present as sepsis mimic and should be considered as a differential diagnosis while managing sepsis with other antimicrobial agents.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the abstracts. The connection between these two substances is not direct but rather mediated through their interactions with the serotonergic system and the potential for inducing serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin**: Dextroamphetamine is known to affect the central nervous system, including influencing serotonin levels and activity. The abstracts suggest that dextroamphetamine's effects can be modulated by serotonergic agents. For instance, the administration of certain serotonergic antagonists can alter the behavioral responses to dextroamphetamine in animal models.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, is associated with the risk of inducing serotonin syndrome, particularly when used in conjunction with serotonergic agents. This is because linezolid has monoamine oxidase inhibiting properties, which can lead to increased levels of serotonin in the brain.

3. **Serotonin Syndrome as a Mediator**: The critical link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is the potential for both to influence serotonin levels, albeit through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin release or affect its reuptake, while linezolid can inhibit the breakdown of serotonin by acting as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be hypothesized as follows: If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine and then starts linezolid therapy, the combination could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome due to the synergistic effects on the serotonergic system. Dextroamphetamine could enhance serotonin release or block its reuptake, while linezolid could reduce serotonin breakdown, leading to excessively high serotonin levels and potentially inducing serotonin syndrome.

5. **Clinical Implications**: This indirect relationship highlights the importance of careful medication management and monitoring when patients are prescribed drugs that can affect the serotonergic system, especially when combining substances like dextroamphetamine with linezolid or other serotonergic agents.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is mediated through their effects on the serotonergic system, with both substances having the potential to contribute to elevated serotonin levels and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when used together. This relationship underscores the need for cautious prescribing practices and close monitoring of patients on these medications to prevent adverse interactions.

Dyskinesias associated with atomoxetine in combination with other psychoactive drugs. Toxicity experience with atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is limited. We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.

D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behaviours in mice with genetically-altered expression of the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. Three human and mouse genes encoding alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2A, alpha2B, and alpha2C) have been cloned. The alpha2C-adrenoceptor is the most abundant alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype in the striatum and modulates metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. To investigate the possible involvement of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor subtype in behaviours regulated by dopamine and serotonin, two strains of genetically-engineered mice were examined. One had a targeted inactivation of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor gene, and the other had tissue-specific over-expression of alpha2C-adrenoceptors. The locomotor activity of the mice was evaluated after stimulation with D-amphetamine, and the behavioural serotonin syndrome and head twitches were investigated after L-5-hydroxytryptophan treatment. In addition, the effects of D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan were studied after pretreatment with dexmedetomidine, a subtype-nonselective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist. The lack of alpha2C-adrenoceptor expression increased and the over-expression of alpha2C-adrenoceptors decreased the response to D-amphetamine stimulation. The effect of alpha2C-adrenoceptor gene inactivation was more prominent in D-amphetamine-treated males than in females. Dexmedetomidine inhibited D-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and the L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced serotonin syndrome, but the inhibition was attenuated in mice lacking alpha2C-adrenoceptors. However, the head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan were effectively inhibited by dexmedetomidine in all studied mice, which suggests that alpha2A-adrenoceptors mediate the inhibition of the head twitch response. The results lend further support to the proposed existence of functionally distinct alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes that can serve as new and specific therapeutic targets in various neuropsychiatric diseases.

A comparison of the fenfluramine-induced serotonergic syndrome in rats subacutely treated with either saline or D-amphetamine. The purpose of this study was to assess the activity of the serotonergic transmitter system in vivo in rats previously exposed to repeated injections of either saline or d-amphetamine. To do so, components of the serotonin syndrome, as induced by various doses of fenfluramine, were scored both before and after a 15-day subacute regimen with these agents. Fenfluramine caused hindlimb abduction, forepaw padding, and straub tail behaviors to be expressed in both groups of animals within 30 min after dosing; little or no activity with respect to these behaviors was seen in either regimen during the 30-60 or 60-90 min intervals. However, body-shaking behavior was consistently observed in both treatment groups during each observation period. No differences in the serotonergic syndrome as a whole or in the expression of each individual component of the syndrome (i.e., hindlimb abduction, straub-tail, forepaw padding, body shakes) were noted either between or within regimens before or after subacute saline or d-amphetamine treatment. Thus, the previously observed decrement in fenfluramine's food intake suppressant action, which resulted from subacute d-amphetamine treatment, is not likely to be due to gross alterations in the central serotonergic system.

Comparison of two cool vests on heat-strain reduction while wearing a firefighting ensemble. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a six-pack versus a four-pack cool vest in reducing heat strain in men dressed in firefighting ensemble, while resting and exercising in a warm/humid environment [34.4 degrees C (day bulb), 28.9 degrees C (wet bulb)]. Male volunteers (n = 12) were monitored for rectal temperature (Tre), mean skin temperature (Tsk), heart rate, and energy expenditure during three test trials: control (no cool vest), four-pack vest, and six-pack vest. The cool vests were worn under the firefighting ensemble and over Navy dungarees. The protocol consisted of two cycles of 30 min seated rest and 30 min walking on a motorized treadmill (1.12 m.s-1, 0% grade). Tolerance time for the control trial (93 min) was significantly less than both vest trials (120 min). Throughout heat exposure, energy expenditure varied during rest and exercise, but no differences existed among all trials (P > 0.05). During the first 60 min of heat exposure, physiological responses were similar for the four-pack and six-pack vests. However, during the second 60 min of heat exposure the six-pack vest had a greater impact on reducing heat strain than the four-pack vest. Peak Tre and Tsk at the end of heat exposure for 6-pack vest [mean (SD) 38.0(0.3) degrees C and 36.8(0.7) degrees C] were significantly lower compared to four-pack [38.6(0.4) degrees C and 38.1(0.5) degrees C] and controls [38.9(0.5) degrees C and 38.4(0.5) degrees C].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Serotonin syndrome associated with linezolid treatment after discontinuation of fluoxetine.

Serotonin syndrome under combination of linezolid and low-dose citalopram with amiodarone.

Linezolid-associated serotonin syndrome: what we can learn from cases reported so far. To study the characteristics of the linezolid-associated serotonin syndrome cases. Database search for linezolid-associated serotonin syndrome. Twelve cases were found. The mean age of patients was 52.8 years. All patients received linezolid concomitantly with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs (SSRID). The onset of syndrome was 9.5 days after linezolid introduction and was directly correlated to patients' age (P = 0.024). The symptoms resolved in 2.9 days. Citalopram was associated with a delayed resolution (P = 0.018). A trend was observed towards longer resolution time the longer the half-life of the interacting drug (P = 0.096). Patients are at risk when receiving SSRID concomitant with linezolid. The syndrome onset could be delayed in older patients. The resolution could be delayed when citalopram is involved in the syndrome.

Risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of linezolid and serotonin agonists. Linezolid, an antimicrobial used to treat resistant gram-positive bacteria, can inhibit monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that metabolizes serotonin and other biogenic amines. Inhibition of this enzyme can predispose patients who are concomitantly taking serotonin agonists to serotonin syndrome. Because of the potential of linezolid to inhibit monoamine oxidase, premarketing studies were conducted with drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. No cases of serotonin syndrome were recorded. After linezolid was released to the United States market, several case reports of serotonin syndrome emerged. A literature search revealed 13 cases of serotonin syndrome occurring with the concomitant use of linezolid and drugs possessing serotonergic properties. To direct clinical management of this potential drug interaction, we reviewed reports of serotonin syndrome to determine relevant drug interactions with linezolid and serotonergic drugs and to characterize similarities and differences in the reported cases. Clinicians should obtain complete drug histories to identify patients at risk, strictly monitor drug therapy including concomitant drugs, and receive education about this potential drug interaction and the symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

Clinical relevance of linezolid-associated serotonin toxicity. To evaluate and review the literature surrounding serotonin toxicity in patients receiving linezolid and determine the clinical relevance of this reaction. Literature was accessed via MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar (both through February 2013) using the search terms linezolid, serotonin syndrome, serotonin toxicity, and adverse reaction. Relevant case reports, retrospective studies, surveys, and review articles were included. Bibliographies of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional sources. Linezolid exhibits mild, nonselective inhibition of monoamine oxidase and has been associated with serotonin toxicity when used in combination with other serotonergic agents. Based on published reports, the incidence of linezolid-associated serotonin toxicity is between 0.54% and 18.2%. Our review identified 32 documented cases, including 3 fatalities. Most cases occurred in patients concurrently receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Receipt of multiple agents with serotonergic activity seems to increase the risk of serotonin toxicity. Both onset and resolution of symptoms varied from hours to days. Current Food and Drug Administration recommendations to avoid the use of linezolid in patients receiving select serotonergic agents highlight the need to carefully balance the risk/benefit ratio in this situation. Although linezolid has been available for 12 years, reports of serotonin toxicity with this agent are uncommon. While clinicians should be aware of this potentially severe interaction and closely monitor patients who are receiving linezolid in combination with serotonergic agents, our findings show that linezolid is not contraindicated in this situation.

An indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Here's a possible narrative connecting the key findings and mechanisms:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on the dopaminergic system**: Dextroamphetamine is a dopaminergic agent that increases dopamine levels in the brain. The second abstract mentions that D-amphetamine (the same as dextroamphetamine) stimulates locomotor activity in mice, which is modulated by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. This receptor subtype is involved in regulating dopamine and serotonin metabolism in the striatum.

2. **Serotonin syndrome and linezolid**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, can inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin and other biogenic amines. When linezolid is co-administered with serotonergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), it can lead to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. This is because the inhibition of MAO by linezolid can cause an accumulation of serotonin in the brain, which can be exacerbated by the concurrent use of serotonergic agents.

3. **Indirect link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid**: Although dextroamphetamine primarily affects the dopaminergic system, it can also indirectly influence the serotonergic system. The first abstract mentions that atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, can cause dyskinesias when combined with dopaminergic agents like dextroamphetamine. Additionally, the third abstract shows that D-amphetamine can affect the serotonergic system, as it alters the response to fenfluramine-induced serotonergic syndrome in rats.

Considering these findings, it's possible that dextroamphetamine could increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when co-administered with linezolid, especially if the patient is also taking serotonergic agents. The mechanism might involve the following steps:

* Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine levels in the brain, which can indirectly affect the serotonergic system.
* Linezolid inhibits MAO, leading to an accumulation of serotonin.
* The combination of increased dopamine and serotonin can exacerbate the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly if the patient is taking other serotonergic agents.

While this narrative provides a possible indirect link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, it's essential to note that the relationship is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including individual patient characteristics, dosages, and concurrent medications. Further research is necessary to fully understand the potential interactions between these agents.

Dyskinesias associated with atomoxetine in combination with other psychoactive drugs. Toxicity experience with atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is limited. We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.

D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behaviours in mice with genetically-altered expression of the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. Three human and mouse genes encoding alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2A, alpha2B, and alpha2C) have been cloned. The alpha2C-adrenoceptor is the most abundant alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype in the striatum and modulates metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. To investigate the possible involvement of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor subtype in behaviours regulated by dopamine and serotonin, two strains of genetically-engineered mice were examined. One had a targeted inactivation of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor gene, and the other had tissue-specific over-expression of alpha2C-adrenoceptors. The locomotor activity of the mice was evaluated after stimulation with D-amphetamine, and the behavioural serotonin syndrome and head twitches were investigated after L-5-hydroxytryptophan treatment. In addition, the effects of D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan were studied after pretreatment with dexmedetomidine, a subtype-nonselective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist. The lack of alpha2C-adrenoceptor expression increased and the over-expression of alpha2C-adrenoceptors decreased the response to D-amphetamine stimulation. The effect of alpha2C-adrenoceptor gene inactivation was more prominent in D-amphetamine-treated males than in females. Dexmedetomidine inhibited D-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and the L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced serotonin syndrome, but the inhibition was attenuated in mice lacking alpha2C-adrenoceptors. However, the head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan were effectively inhibited by dexmedetomidine in all studied mice, which suggests that alpha2A-adrenoceptors mediate the inhibition of the head twitch response. The results lend further support to the proposed existence of functionally distinct alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes that can serve as new and specific therapeutic targets in various neuropsychiatric diseases.

A comparison of the fenfluramine-induced serotonergic syndrome in rats subacutely treated with either saline or D-amphetamine. The purpose of this study was to assess the activity of the serotonergic transmitter system in vivo in rats previously exposed to repeated injections of either saline or d-amphetamine. To do so, components of the serotonin syndrome, as induced by various doses of fenfluramine, were scored both before and after a 15-day subacute regimen with these agents. Fenfluramine caused hindlimb abduction, forepaw padding, and straub tail behaviors to be expressed in both groups of animals within 30 min after dosing; little or no activity with respect to these behaviors was seen in either regimen during the 30-60 or 60-90 min intervals. However, body-shaking behavior was consistently observed in both treatment groups during each observation period. No differences in the serotonergic syndrome as a whole or in the expression of each individual component of the syndrome (i.e., hindlimb abduction, straub-tail, forepaw padding, body shakes) were noted either between or within regimens before or after subacute saline or d-amphetamine treatment. Thus, the previously observed decrement in fenfluramine's food intake suppressant action, which resulted from subacute d-amphetamine treatment, is not likely to be due to gross alterations in the central serotonergic system.

Comparison of two cool vests on heat-strain reduction while wearing a firefighting ensemble. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a six-pack versus a four-pack cool vest in reducing heat strain in men dressed in firefighting ensemble, while resting and exercising in a warm/humid environment [34.4 degrees C (day bulb), 28.9 degrees C (wet bulb)]. Male volunteers (n = 12) were monitored for rectal temperature (Tre), mean skin temperature (Tsk), heart rate, and energy expenditure during three test trials: control (no cool vest), four-pack vest, and six-pack vest. The cool vests were worn under the firefighting ensemble and over Navy dungarees. The protocol consisted of two cycles of 30 min seated rest and 30 min walking on a motorized treadmill (1.12 m.s-1, 0% grade). Tolerance time for the control trial (93 min) was significantly less than both vest trials (120 min). Throughout heat exposure, energy expenditure varied during rest and exercise, but no differences existed among all trials (P > 0.05). During the first 60 min of heat exposure, physiological responses were similar for the four-pack and six-pack vests. However, during the second 60 min of heat exposure the six-pack vest had a greater impact on reducing heat strain than the four-pack vest. Peak Tre and Tsk at the end of heat exposure for 6-pack vest [mean (SD) 38.0(0.3) degrees C and 36.8(0.7) degrees C] were significantly lower compared to four-pack [38.6(0.4) degrees C and 38.1(0.5) degrees C] and controls [38.9(0.5) degrees C and 38.4(0.5) degrees C].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Serotonin syndrome under combination of linezolid and low-dose citalopram with amiodarone.

Linezolid-associated serotonin syndrome: what we can learn from cases reported so far. To study the characteristics of the linezolid-associated serotonin syndrome cases. Database search for linezolid-associated serotonin syndrome. Twelve cases were found. The mean age of patients was 52.8 years. All patients received linezolid concomitantly with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs (SSRID). The onset of syndrome was 9.5 days after linezolid introduction and was directly correlated to patients' age (P = 0.024). The symptoms resolved in 2.9 days. Citalopram was associated with a delayed resolution (P = 0.018). A trend was observed towards longer resolution time the longer the half-life of the interacting drug (P = 0.096). Patients are at risk when receiving SSRID concomitant with linezolid. The syndrome onset could be delayed in older patients. The resolution could be delayed when citalopram is involved in the syndrome.

Risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of linezolid and serotonin agonists. Linezolid, an antimicrobial used to treat resistant gram-positive bacteria, can inhibit monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that metabolizes serotonin and other biogenic amines. Inhibition of this enzyme can predispose patients who are concomitantly taking serotonin agonists to serotonin syndrome. Because of the potential of linezolid to inhibit monoamine oxidase, premarketing studies were conducted with drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. No cases of serotonin syndrome were recorded. After linezolid was released to the United States market, several case reports of serotonin syndrome emerged. A literature search revealed 13 cases of serotonin syndrome occurring with the concomitant use of linezolid and drugs possessing serotonergic properties. To direct clinical management of this potential drug interaction, we reviewed reports of serotonin syndrome to determine relevant drug interactions with linezolid and serotonergic drugs and to characterize similarities and differences in the reported cases. Clinicians should obtain complete drug histories to identify patients at risk, strictly monitor drug therapy including concomitant drugs, and receive education about this potential drug interaction and the symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

Clinical relevance of linezolid-associated serotonin toxicity. To evaluate and review the literature surrounding serotonin toxicity in patients receiving linezolid and determine the clinical relevance of this reaction. Literature was accessed via MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar (both through February 2013) using the search terms linezolid, serotonin syndrome, serotonin toxicity, and adverse reaction. Relevant case reports, retrospective studies, surveys, and review articles were included. Bibliographies of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional sources. Linezolid exhibits mild, nonselective inhibition of monoamine oxidase and has been associated with serotonin toxicity when used in combination with other serotonergic agents. Based on published reports, the incidence of linezolid-associated serotonin toxicity is between 0.54% and 18.2%. Our review identified 32 documented cases, including 3 fatalities. Most cases occurred in patients concurrently receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Receipt of multiple agents with serotonergic activity seems to increase the risk of serotonin toxicity. Both onset and resolution of symptoms varied from hours to days. Current Food and Drug Administration recommendations to avoid the use of linezolid in patients receiving select serotonergic agents highlight the need to carefully balance the risk/benefit ratio in this situation. Although linezolid has been available for 12 years, reports of serotonin toxicity with this agent are uncommon. While clinicians should be aware of this potentially severe interaction and closely monitor patients who are receiving linezolid in combination with serotonergic agents, our findings show that linezolid is not contraindicated in this situation.

Anticipating potential linezolid-SSRI interactions in the general hospital setting: an MAOI in disguise. Linezolid, a novel antimicrobial with activity against gram-positive bacteria including pathogens resistant to traditional antimicrobials, also inhibits monoamine oxidase. This latter property can cause potentially lethal adverse interactions with antidepressant medications. Long known to psychiatrists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and complications of their use may be unfamiliar to medical and surgical practitioners who may thus unwittingly precipitate a hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome. We review the pharmacology of MAOis and describe 3 clinical situations In which linezolid-selective serotonin inhibitor (SSRI) interactions, actual or potential, figured prominently.

An indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Here's a possible narrative connecting the key findings and underlying mechanisms:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's effect on the dopaminergic system**: Dextroamphetamine is a dopaminergic agent that increases dopamine levels in the brain. The second abstract mentions that D-amphetamine (the same as dextroamphetamine) stimulates locomotor activity in mice, which is modulated by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. This suggests that dextroamphetamine's effects on the dopaminergic system might be influenced by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype.

2. **Alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype's role in modulating serotonin and dopamine**: The second abstract also states that the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype modulates the metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. This implies that alterations in the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype could affect the balance between serotonin and dopamine in the brain.

3. **Linezolid's inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO)**: The linezolid-related abstracts mention that linezolid inhibits MAO, an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin, dopamine, and other biogenic amines. This inhibition can lead to increased levels of these neurotransmitters, potentially causing serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic agents.

4. **Potential interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid**: Although there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, the indirect relationship might arise from their effects on the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. Dextroamphetamine's increase in dopamine levels could potentially interact with linezolid's inhibition of MAO, leading to increased levels of both dopamine and serotonin. If the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype is involved in modulating this interaction, alterations in its expression or function could influence the risk of serotonin syndrome when combining dextroamphetamine with linezolid.

5. **Serotonin syndrome as a potential outcome**: The linezolid-related abstracts highlight the risk of serotonin syndrome when combining linezolid with serotonergic agents. If dextroamphetamine's effects on the dopaminergic system indirectly contribute to increased serotonin levels, the combination of dextroamphetamine and linezolid could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might arise from their interactions with the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, potentially modulated by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. While there is no direct evidence of a interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, their combined effects on neurotransmitter levels could increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction and closely monitor patients receiving dextroamphetamine and linezolid concurrently.

Apoptosis induced by isoliquiritigenin in human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells. Isoliquiritigenin, which is possibly a principal anti-tumor constituent of licorice, a traditional Chinese herb, was examined for apoptosis-inducing activity in human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells. Typical morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA ladder formation, and appearance of apoptotic peaks (subG(1)) were observed in MGC-803 cells with isoliquiritigenin treatment. Using Fluo-3 and Rh123 as fluorescent probes, respectively, it was found that the intracellular free calcium concentration increased and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) decreased in a dose-dependent manner in apoptotic cells. These results suggest that isoliquiritigenin induced apoptosis of MGC-803 cells through calcium- and Deltapsi(m)-dependent pathways, indicating that it is potentially useful as a natural anti-cancer agent.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the abstracts. The connection between these two substances is not direct but can be understood through their interactions with other entities and processes, particularly those involving neurotransmitter systems.

1. **Dextroamphetamine's Mechanism**: Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It does this by promoting the release of these neurotransmitters and inhibiting their reuptake.

2. **Linezolid's Interaction with Serotonin**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, has a secondary effect as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). MAOIs prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), leading to an increase in their concentrations in the brain. When linezolid is used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonergic agents, it can lead to an excessive accumulation of serotonin, potentially causing serotonin syndrome.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be hypothesized through their effects on neurotransmitter systems. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels, and while its primary action is not on the serotonin system, alterations in dopamine and norepinephrine can indirectly affect serotonin regulation due to the complex interactions between these neurotransmitter systems. For instance, increased dopamine can influence serotonin release and metabolism in certain parts of the brain.

4. **Alpha2C-Adrenoceptors**: The study on alpha2C-adrenoceptor subtypes suggests that these receptors modulate the metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. Dextroamphetamine's effects on dopamine could potentially be influenced by the activity of these receptors. If linezolid, through its MAOI activity, affects the serotonin system, and considering the interconnectedness of neurotransmitter systems, there could be an indirect influence on dopamine and norepinephrine systems as well.

5. **Clinical Implications**: The risk of serotonin syndrome with linezolid and SSRIs highlights the importance of monitoring drug interactions. While dextroamphetamine is not typically associated with serotonin syndrome directly, its use in combination with other drugs that affect serotonin levels (including linezolid) could potentially exacerbate risks due to its effects on other neurotransmitter systems that interact with serotonin.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid involves the complex interplay of neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Dextroamphetamine's effects on dopamine and norepinephrine, combined with linezolid's inhibition of monoamine oxidase (which affects serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), create a scenario where the use of these drugs together could potentially lead to unpredictable neurotransmitter imbalances. This relationship underscores the need for careful consideration of drug interactions and monitoring in clinical practice.

Dyskinesias associated with atomoxetine in combination with other psychoactive drugs. Toxicity experience with atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is limited. We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.

D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behaviours in mice with genetically-altered expression of the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype. Three human and mouse genes encoding alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2A, alpha2B, and alpha2C) have been cloned. The alpha2C-adrenoceptor is the most abundant alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype in the striatum and modulates metabolism of both dopamine and serotonin. To investigate the possible involvement of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor subtype in behaviours regulated by dopamine and serotonin, two strains of genetically-engineered mice were examined. One had a targeted inactivation of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor gene, and the other had tissue-specific over-expression of alpha2C-adrenoceptors. The locomotor activity of the mice was evaluated after stimulation with D-amphetamine, and the behavioural serotonin syndrome and head twitches were investigated after L-5-hydroxytryptophan treatment. In addition, the effects of D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan were studied after pretreatment with dexmedetomidine, a subtype-nonselective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist. The lack of alpha2C-adrenoceptor expression increased and the over-expression of alpha2C-adrenoceptors decreased the response to D-amphetamine stimulation. The effect of alpha2C-adrenoceptor gene inactivation was more prominent in D-amphetamine-treated males than in females. Dexmedetomidine inhibited D-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and the L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced serotonin syndrome, but the inhibition was attenuated in mice lacking alpha2C-adrenoceptors. However, the head twitches induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan were effectively inhibited by dexmedetomidine in all studied mice, which suggests that alpha2A-adrenoceptors mediate the inhibition of the head twitch response. The results lend further support to the proposed existence of functionally distinct alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes that can serve as new and specific therapeutic targets in various neuropsychiatric diseases.

During the first 60 min of heat exposure, physiological responses were similar for the four-pack and six-pack vests. However, during the second 60 min of heat exposure the six-pack vest had a greater impact on reducing heat strain than the four-pack vest. Peak Tre and Tsk at the end of heat exposure for 6-pack vest [mean (SD) 38.0(0.3) degrees C and 36.8(0.7) degrees C] were significantly lower compared to four-pack [38.6(0.4) degrees C and 38.1(0.5) degrees C] and controls [38.9(0.5) degrees C and 38.4(0.5) degrees C].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Apoptosis induced by isoliquiritigenin in human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells. Isoliquiritigenin, which is possibly a principal anti-tumor constituent of licorice, a traditional Chinese herb, was examined for apoptosis-inducing activity in human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells. Typical morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA ladder formation, and appearance of apoptotic peaks (subG(1)) were observed in MGC-803 cells with isoliquiritigenin treatment. Using Fluo-3 and Rh123 as fluorescent probes, respectively, it was found that the intracellular free calcium concentration increased and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) decreased in a dose-dependent manner in apoptotic cells. These results suggest that isoliquiritigenin induced apoptosis of MGC-803 cells through calcium- and Deltapsi(m)-dependent pathways, indicating that it is potentially useful as a natural anti-cancer agent.

Serotonin syndrome under combination of linezolid and low-dose citalopram with amiodarone.

Risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of linezolid and serotonin agonists. Linezolid, an antimicrobial used to treat resistant gram-positive bacteria, can inhibit monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that metabolizes serotonin and other biogenic amines. Inhibition of this enzyme can predispose patients who are concomitantly taking serotonin agonists to serotonin syndrome. Because of the potential of linezolid to inhibit monoamine oxidase, premarketing studies were conducted with drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. No cases of serotonin syndrome were recorded. After linezolid was released to the United States market, several case reports of serotonin syndrome emerged. A literature search revealed 13 cases of serotonin syndrome occurring with the concomitant use of linezolid and drugs possessing serotonergic properties. To direct clinical management of this potential drug interaction, we reviewed reports of serotonin syndrome to determine relevant drug interactions with linezolid and serotonergic drugs and to characterize similarities and differences in the reported cases. Clinicians should obtain complete drug histories to identify patients at risk, strictly monitor drug therapy including concomitant drugs, and receive education about this potential drug interaction and the symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

Clinical relevance of linezolid-associated serotonin toxicity. To evaluate and review the literature surrounding serotonin toxicity in patients receiving linezolid and determine the clinical relevance of this reaction. Literature was accessed via MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar (both through February 2013) using the search terms linezolid, serotonin syndrome, serotonin toxicity, and adverse reaction. Relevant case reports, retrospective studies, surveys, and review articles were included. Bibliographies of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional sources. Linezolid exhibits mild, nonselective inhibition of monoamine oxidase and has been associated with serotonin toxicity when used in combination with other serotonergic agents. Based on published reports, the incidence of linezolid-associated serotonin toxicity is between 0.54% and 18.2%. Our review identified 32 documented cases, including 3 fatalities. Most cases occurred in patients concurrently receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Receipt of multiple agents with serotonergic activity seems to increase the risk of serotonin toxicity. Both onset and resolution of symptoms varied from hours to days. Current Food and Drug Administration recommendations to avoid the use of linezolid in patients receiving select serotonergic agents highlight the need to carefully balance the risk/benefit ratio in this situation. Although linezolid has been available for 12 years, reports of serotonin toxicity with this agent are uncommon. While clinicians should be aware of this potentially severe interaction and closely monitor patients who are receiving linezolid in combination with serotonergic agents, our findings show that linezolid is not contraindicated in this situation.

Anticipating potential linezolid-SSRI interactions in the general hospital setting: an MAOI in disguise. Linezolid, a novel antimicrobial with activity against gram-positive bacteria including pathogens resistant to traditional antimicrobials, also inhibits monoamine oxidase. This latter property can cause potentially lethal adverse interactions with antidepressant medications. Long known to psychiatrists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and complications of their use may be unfamiliar to medical and surgical practitioners who may thus unwittingly precipitate a hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome. We review the pharmacology of MAOis and describe 3 clinical situations In which linezolid-selective serotonin inhibitor (SSRI) interactions, actual or potential, figured prominently.

Benefit-risk assessment of linezolid for serious gram-positive bacterial infections. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone, a new class of antibacterial with a unique mechanism of action, namely inhibition of the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex in the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit. Linezolid is highly active against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci; its spectrum of activity also includes some anaerobic bacteria. Linezolid has been studied in several randomized controlled trials for the treatment of patients with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), urinary tract infections and bacteraemia. The available evidence suggests that linezolid is at least as effective as vancomycin for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, and there are some retrospective analyses supporting its superiority in comparison with vancomycin for MRSA nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia. Linezolid is more effective than glycopeptides, macrolides and beta-lactams for SSTIs. The limited available data for the treatment of patients with bacteraemia suggest that it may be a better treatment option than vancomycin and beta-lactams for these patients, but questions have arisen regarding patients with catheter-related bacteraemias. Compared with other antibacterials, linezolid is associated with a greater frequency of adverse events, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headaches. Thrombocytopenia also occurs more frequently in patients taking linezolid but there is no increased frequency of anaemia. Other adverse events potentially related to linezolid therapy include fungal infections (moniliasis), hypertension and serotonin-like syndrome, tongue discolouration and taste alterations, dizziness, insomnia, rash and Clostridium difficile-related diarrhoea. The majority of adverse events develop after prolonged administration (i.e. >2 weeks) and subside shortly after discontinuation of linezolid. Peripheral or optic neuropathy, another possible adverse effect, is associated with an even longer duration of treatment (3-6 months). In conclusion, linezolid is an important treatment option for the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant, Gram-positive bacterial infections. However, in order to reduce the possibility of development of resistance and preserve its activity, the use of linezolid should be restricted to treatment of patients with infections associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the abstracts. 

1. **Dextroamphetamine's Mechanism**: Dextroamphetamine is a dopaminergic and noradrenergic medication, primarily used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain by promoting their release and inhibiting their reuptake.

2. **Linezolid's Mechanism**: Linezolid is an antibiotic that inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down monoamines such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. By inhibiting MAO, linezolid can increase the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain.

3. **Serotonin Syndrome**: The abstracts mention the risk of serotonin syndrome when linezolid is used with serotonergic agents. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive levels of serotonin in the body. It can occur when certain medications, including MAO inhibitors like linezolid, are taken together with drugs that increase serotonin levels.

4. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be related to their effects on neurotransmitter levels. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels, and while it does not directly affect serotonin levels, its use in combination with other medications that influence serotonin could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with an MAO inhibitor like linezolid. 

5. **Intermediate Entities or Processes**: The key intermediate entity in this relationship is the increase in neurotransmitter levels, particularly serotonin, when linezolid is used with medications that have serotonergic properties. Dextroamphetamine, by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine, might not directly contribute to serotonin syndrome but could potentially exacerbate the condition in a complex drug interaction scenario involving serotonergic agents and linezolid.

6. **Alpha2C-Adrenergic Receptor Subtype**: The study on D-amphetamine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behaviors in mice with genetically altered expression of the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype suggests that this receptor plays a role in modulating dopamine and serotonin metabolism. The interaction between dextroamphetamine (a dopaminergic agent) and linezolid (an MAO inhibitor) could theoretically be influenced by the alpha2C-adrenergic receptor subtype, as it affects the balance of these neurotransmitters.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their potential to influence neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Dextroamphetamine increases dopamine and norepinephrine, while linezolid, by inhibiting MAO, can increase serotonin levels. In a scenario where dextroamphetamine is used with other medications that affect serotonin, the addition of linezolid could potentially lead to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the cumulative effect on neurotransmitter levels. This relationship highlights the importance of careful drug interaction monitoring, especially when combining medications that can affect the brain's neurotransmitter balance.

Differentiaton of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine. The dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine elicit hyperthermic, hyperkinetic and stereotypic responses in the rabbit. The present investigation compares the influence exerted by various serotonergic antagonists upon these activities. Apomorphine-induced hyperthemia was antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), cyproheptadine and cinanserin and was restored in pCPA-pretreated rabbits by regeneration of central serotonin levels, d-Amphetamine-induced hyperthermia was reduced by pCPA; restored in pCPA-pretreated animals by regeneration of central serotonin levels; and was uninfluenced by cyproheptadine and cinanserin. Apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation was unaltered by serotonergic antagonists; however, these same doses of anti-serotonergic agents all markedly reduced d-amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. Serotonergic antgaonists also failed to affect apomorphine-induced compulsive gnawing but did significantly enhance d-amphetamine-induced compulsive gnawing. It is concluded from these data that the neuropharmacological activities of apopmorphine and d-amphetamine in the rabbit differ in their dependence upon central serotonergic mechanisms.

Knowledge of patient's method of payment by physicians in a group practice. Physicians generally know how patients pay for their medical care. At the Marshfield Clinic, however, a group practice in Marshfield, Wis., physicians did not know the source of payment for the vast majority of their patients (79.3 percent). Also, even for the approximately one-fifth of the patients whose payment status they reported knowing, the information was incorrect for a small proportion. The patient's age and sex, length of time the physician had provided care, patient's place of employment, reason for patient's visit, and whether the physician was in the medical or surgical department apparently affected the physician's knowledge of the patient's payment status. Twenty-five of the 49 physicians studied reported they knew the payment status of none of their patients about whom they were asked; 24 knew the status of at least one patient. Only one physician in seven, however, reported having this knowledge about all the patients about whom he was asked. Physicians in medicine were more likely than those in surgical sub-specialties to know the patient's payment status. About one physician in five said such knowledge would be helpful for at least one patient; about one in seven said it would be helpful for all patients about whom they were asked. The Marshfield Clinic physicians, who receive salaries, emphasize comprehensive care and increased access to care, rather than maximization of income. The clinic offers medical care to patients in a prepayment health plan while continuing to serve other patients on a fee-for-service basis. Arrangements like this may help ease the transition to repayment if health-maintenance organizations become predominant in the delivery of health services in the United States.

Women's experiences with breastfeeding in public: An integrative review. Much evidence around public breastfeeding does not reflect experiences of the key stakeholder, the breastfeeding woman, and focuses upon the audience. Selective evidence has explored breastfeeding experiences revealing challenges with public breastfeeding as a serendipitous finding. Although women's experiences have been explored in specific contexts, insight into commonalities reflective of an international perspective is unknown. to explore, review and synthesise published literature on women's experience with public breastfeeding. An integrative review allows inclusion of findings beyond empirical evidence. Whittemore and Knafl's approach was used to capture and analyse evidence from varied sources to provide understanding of a phenomenon from diverse methodologies. PubMed, Medline, Ovid emBase, Scopus, Science Direct, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and PsychINFO were searched. Inclusion criteria included publications in English after 2005 offering descriptions of women's experiences. Data evaluation included assessment of literature quality. A constant comparison approach involved comparing, analysing and drawing similar concepts into themes. Integration of women's experience with public breastfeeding from 27 publications covering 12 countries revealed two key themes, what women shared as 'enhancing' and 'challenging'. Challenges included four subthemes: 'drawing attention', 'sexualisation of breasts', 'awareness of others' discomfort', and 'efforts not to be seen'. Enhancing incorporated subthemes: 'supportive audience' and 'confidence'. Challenges confirm an international commonality that women encounter during public breastfeeding suggesting a multilayered approach addressing community and societal behaviours is required. Insight to enhance public breastfeeding experiences offers direction to improve support.

Effects of joy and sorrow on pulse-graph parameters in healthy female college students based on emotion-evoked experiments. To explore the effects of joy and sorrow on pulse-graph parameters in healthy subjects and analyze their potential effect to provide preliminary evidence that pulse diagnosis can identify human emotional changes. Forty healthy female college students from Beijing University of Chinese Medicine were recruited. The emotion-evoking experiment was conducted to observe the effects of joy and sorrow on pulse-graph parameters, taking neutral emotion as a control. The experiment included the following criteria. (1) Emotions evoked and evaluated: the same subjects watched three emotional videos which were, respectively, neutral, joyful and sorrowful to evoke the corresponding emotions. They completed the "subjective emotion evaluation form" (SEEF) before watching each video (T0), immediately after watching the video (T1) and 15 min after watching the video (T2) to conduct subjective emotion evaluation. Simultaneously, their heart rate, galvanic skin response and heart rate variability were collected with a 16-lead physiological recorder to conduct an objective evaluation of emotional arousal. (2) Collection of pulse-graph parameters: pulse-graph parameters of the subjects at T0, T1 and T2 were collected with a pulse condition analyzer. When watching the joy video, the rapid ejection phase extended significantly, both the left ventricular diastole and the cardiac cycle shortened significantly. When watching the sorrow video, the left ventricular diastole extended significantly, the cardiac cycle showed an upward trend, and heart rate showed a downward trend. Joy and sorrow have a certain effect on pulse-graph parameters of the subjects. The mechanisms may be that joy contributes to rapid ejection phase extension and a shortening of the left ventricular diastole and the cardiac cycle, while sorrow extends the left ventricular diastole. According to the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the visceral functions can be mediated through human qi flow. Moderate joy and sorrow can promote, respectively, the smooth qi flow of the heart and the lung. However, excessive or long-term joy and sorrow can lead to disharmonious qi flow of the two viscera. Therefore, maintaining moderate emotions is beneficial to the physiological functions of the viscera. Great emotional fluctuations may damage the visceral functions. Future studies with effects of other emotions on pulse-graph parameters are warranted to determine the reliability of the association of emotions and pulse diagnosis.

Serotonin Syndrome: Prophylactic Treatment With Cyproheptadine. Despite the numerous advantages of linezolid therapy, one disadvantage continuing to hinder its use is the risk of serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents. Developing a better understanding of serotonin syndrome is essential for the prevention and management of this potentially life-threatening condition. This report describes a patient with schizophrenia, depression, and severe, acute osteomyelitis. The patient was taking multiple serotonergic agents and required the use of linezolid without the possibility of a sufficient washout period. The severity of the patient's condition in conjunction with increased risk for serotonin syndrome warranted prophylactic treatment with cyproheptadine. The complex pathophysiology of prophylactic treatment of serotonin syndrome with cyproheptadine is worthy of discussion.

Myocardial contraction is 5-fold more economical in ventricular than in atrial human tissue. Cardiac energetics and performance depend on the expression level of the fast (alpha-) and slow (beta-) myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform. In ventricular tissue, the beta-MHC isoform predominates, whereas in atrial tissue a variable mixture of alpha- and beta-MHC is found. In several cardiac diseases, the slow isoform is upregulated; however, the functional implications of this transition in human myocardium are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between contractile properties and MHC isoform composition in healthy human myocardium using the diversity in atrial tissue. Isometric force production and ATP consumption were measured in chemically skinned atrial trabeculae and ventricular muscle strips, and rate of force redevelopment was studied using single cardiomyocytes. MHC isoform composition was determined by one-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis. Force development in ventricular tissue was about 5-fold more economical, but nine times slower, than in atrial tissue. Significant linear correlations were found between MHC isoform composition, ATP consumption and rate of force redevelopment. These results clearly indicate that even a minor shift in MHC isoform expression has considerable impact on cardiac performance in human tissue.

Entanglement Entropy of the nu=1/2 Composite Fermion Non-Fermi Liquid State. The so-called "non-Fermi liquid" behavior is very common in strongly correlated systems. However, its operational definition in terms of "what it is not" is a major obstacle for the theoretical understanding of this fascinating correlated state. Recently there has been much interest in entanglement entropy as a theoretical tool to study non-Fermi liquids. So far explicit calculations have been limited to models without direct experimental realizations. Here we focus on a two-dimensional electron fluid under magnetic field and filling fraction nu=1/2, which is believed to be a non-Fermi liquid state. Using a composite fermion wave function which captures the nu=1/2 state very accurately, we compute the second Renyi entropy using the variational Monte Carlo technique. We find the entanglement entropy scales as LlogL with the length of the boundary L as it does for free fermions, but has a prefactor twice that of free fermions.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the provided abstracts. Although there is no direct mention of a relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid in the abstracts, we can infer a possible indirect linkage through the involvement of serotonergic mechanisms and the potential for serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin**: The first abstract discusses the differentiation of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine, highlighting that d-amphetamine-induced hyperthermia and hyperkinesia are influenced by serotonergic antagonists. This suggests that dextroamphetamine's effects are modulated by the serotonin system.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: The abstract on serotonin syndrome mentions that linezolid, an antibiotic, can cause serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents. This indicates that linezolid interacts with the serotonin system, potentially increasing serotonin levels or activity.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: Given that dextroamphetamine's effects are modulated by the serotonin system and linezolid can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome by interacting with serotonergic agents, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could exist through their shared interaction with the serotonin system. If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine (which affects serotonin levels or activity) and is then prescribed linezolid, there could be an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the combined effect on the serotonin system.

4. **Cyproheptadine as a Mediator**: The abstract on prophylactic treatment with cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome provides a potential mediator in this indirect relationship. Cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, can be used to prevent serotonin syndrome in patients at risk, such as those taking linezolid with other serotonergic agents. If dextroamphetamine is one of those agents, the use of cyproheptadine could mitigate the risk of serotonin syndrome, further illustrating the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid through their effects on the serotonin system.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their interactions with the serotonin system. Dextroamphetamine's neuropharmacological effects are influenced by serotonergic mechanisms, and linezolid increases the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic agents. This shared interaction with the serotonin system, potentially mediated by the use of serotonergic antagonists like cyproheptadine to prevent serotonin syndrome, forms the basis of their indirect relationship.

Differentiaton of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine. The dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine elicit hyperthermic, hyperkinetic and stereotypic responses in the rabbit. The present investigation compares the influence exerted by various serotonergic antagonists upon these activities. Apomorphine-induced hyperthemia was antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), cyproheptadine and cinanserin and was restored in pCPA-pretreated rabbits by regeneration of central serotonin levels, d-Amphetamine-induced hyperthermia was reduced by pCPA; restored in pCPA-pretreated animals by regeneration of central serotonin levels; and was uninfluenced by cyproheptadine and cinanserin. Apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation was unaltered by serotonergic antagonists; however, these same doses of anti-serotonergic agents all markedly reduced d-amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. Serotonergic antgaonists also failed to affect apomorphine-induced compulsive gnawing but did significantly enhance d-amphetamine-induced compulsive gnawing. It is concluded from these data that the neuropharmacological activities of apopmorphine and d-amphetamine in the rabbit differ in their dependence upon central serotonergic mechanisms.

Joy and sorrow have a certain effect on pulse-graph parameters of the subjects.

Therefore, maintaining moderate emotions is beneficial to the physiological functions of the viscera. Great emotional fluctuations may damage the visceral functions. Future studies with effects of other emotions on pulse-graph parameters are warranted to determine the reliability of the association of emotions and pulse diagnosis.

The complex pathophysiology of prophylactic treatment of serotonin syndrome with cyproheptadine is worthy of discussion.

Myocardial contraction is 5-fold more economical in ventricular than in atrial human tissue. Cardiac energetics and performance depend on the expression level of the fast (alpha-) and slow (beta-) myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform. In ventricular tissue, the beta-MHC isoform predominates, whereas in atrial tissue a variable mixture of alpha- and beta-MHC is found. In several cardiac diseases, the slow isoform is upregulated; however, the functional implications of this transition in human myocardium are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between contractile properties and MHC isoform composition in healthy human myocardium using the diversity in atrial tissue. Isometric force production and ATP consumption were measured in chemically skinned atrial trabeculae and ventricular muscle strips, and rate of force redevelopment was studied using single cardiomyocytes. MHC isoform composition was determined by one-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis. Force development in ventricular tissue was about 5-fold more economical, but nine times slower, than in atrial tissue. Significant linear correlations were found between MHC isoform composition, ATP consumption and rate of force redevelopment. These results clearly indicate that even a minor shift in MHC isoform expression has considerable impact on cardiac performance in human tissue.

Entanglement Entropy of the nu=1/2 Composite Fermion Non-Fermi Liquid State. The so-called "non-Fermi liquid" behavior is very common in strongly correlated systems. However, its operational definition in terms of "what it is not" is a major obstacle for the theoretical understanding of this fascinating correlated state. Recently there has been much interest in entanglement entropy as a theoretical tool to study non-Fermi liquids. So far explicit calculations have been limited to models without direct experimental realizations. Here we focus on a two-dimensional electron fluid under magnetic field and filling fraction nu=1/2, which is believed to be a non-Fermi liquid state. Using a composite fermion wave function which captures the nu=1/2 state very accurately, we compute the second Renyi entropy using the variational Monte Carlo technique. We find the entanglement entropy scales as LlogL with the length of the boundary L as it does for free fermions, but has a prefactor twice that of free fermions.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the provided abstracts. Although there is no direct mention of a relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid in the abstracts, we can infer a possible indirect connection through the involvement of serotonergic mechanisms and the potential for serotonin syndrome.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin**: The first abstract discusses the differentiation of neuropharmacological actions of apomorphine and d-amphetamine, highlighting that d-amphetamine-induced hyperthermia and hyperkinesia are influenced by serotonergic antagonists. This suggests that dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) interacts with the serotonergic system.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: The abstract on serotonin syndrome mentions that linezolid, an antibiotic, can cause serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents. This indicates that linezolid has the potential to interact with the serotonergic system, particularly when used in conjunction with drugs that affect serotonin levels.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: Given that dextroamphetamine can influence serotonergic activity and linezolid can contribute to serotonin syndrome in the presence of other serotonergic agents, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their shared interaction with the serotonergic system. If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine and is then prescribed linezolid, there could be an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the combined effect on serotonin levels. This risk would be an example of an indirect relationship, where the two drugs do not directly interact but can have a significant interaction through their effects on a common system (in this case, the serotonergic system).

4. **Cyproheptadine as a Mediator**: The abstract on prophylactic treatment with cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome provides further insight into managing the risk associated with linezolid and serotonergic agents. Cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, can be used to mitigate the risk of serotonin syndrome. This suggests that in a scenario where dextroamphetamine and linezolid are used together, cyproheptadine could potentially play a role in managing the indirect interaction between these two drugs by reducing the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their potential to interact with the serotonergic system. Dextroamphetamine can affect serotonergic activity, and linezolid can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic agents. This indirect relationship highlights the importance of careful consideration and management when prescribing these drugs together to avoid adverse interactions.

Knowledge of patient's method of payment by physicians in a group practice. Physicians generally know how patients pay for their medical care. At the Marshfield Clinic, however, a group practice in Marshfield, Wis., physicians did not know the source of payment for the vast majority of their patients (79.3 percent). Also, even for the approximately one-fifth of the patients whose payment status they reported knowing, the information was incorrect for a small proportion. The patient's age and sex, length of time the physician had provided care, patient's place of employment, reason for patient's visit, and whether the physician was in the medical or surgical department apparently affected the physician's knowledge of the patient's payment status. Twenty-five of the 49 physicians studied reported they knew the payment status of none of their patients about whom they were asked; 24 knew the status of at least one patient. Only one physician in seven, however, reported having this knowledge about all the patients about whom he was asked. Physicians in medicine were more likely than those in surgical sub-specialties to know the patient's payment status. About one physician in five said such knowledge would be helpful for at least one patient; about one in seven said it would be helpful for all patients about whom they were asked. The Marshfield Clinic physicians, who receive salaries, emphasize comprehensive care and increased access to care, rather than maximization of income. The clinic offers medical care to patients in a prepayment health plan while continuing to serve other patients on a fee-for-service basis. Arrangements like this may help ease the transition to repayment if health-maintenance organizations become predominant in the delivery of health services in the United States.

Women's experiences with breastfeeding in public: An integrative review. Much evidence around public breastfeeding does not reflect experiences of the key stakeholder, the breastfeeding woman, and focuses upon the audience. Selective evidence has explored breastfeeding experiences revealing challenges with public breastfeeding as a serendipitous finding. Although women's experiences have been explored in specific contexts, insight into commonalities reflective of an international perspective is unknown. to explore, review and synthesise published literature on women's experience with public breastfeeding. An integrative review allows inclusion of findings beyond empirical evidence. Whittemore and Knafl's approach was used to capture and analyse evidence from varied sources to provide understanding of a phenomenon from diverse methodologies. PubMed, Medline, Ovid emBase, Scopus, Science Direct, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and PsychINFO were searched. Inclusion criteria included publications in English after 2005 offering descriptions of women's experiences. Data evaluation included assessment of literature quality. A constant comparison approach involved comparing, analysing and drawing similar concepts into themes. Integration of women's experience with public breastfeeding from 27 publications covering 12 countries revealed two key themes, what women shared as 'enhancing' and 'challenging'. Challenges included four subthemes: 'drawing attention', 'sexualisation of breasts', 'awareness of others' discomfort', and 'efforts not to be seen'. Enhancing incorporated subthemes: 'supportive audience' and 'confidence'. Challenges confirm an international commonality that women encounter during public breastfeeding suggesting a multilayered approach addressing community and societal behaviours is required. Insight to enhance public breastfeeding experiences offers direction to improve support.

Effects of joy and sorrow on pulse-graph parameters in healthy female college students based on emotion-evoked experiments. To explore the effects of joy and sorrow on pulse-graph parameters in healthy subjects and analyze their potential effect to provide preliminary evidence that pulse diagnosis can identify human emotional changes. Forty healthy female college students from Beijing University of Chinese Medicine were recruited. The emotion-evoking experiment was conducted to observe the effects of joy and sorrow on pulse-graph parameters, taking neutral emotion as a control. The experiment included the following criteria. (1) Emotions evoked and evaluated: the same subjects watched three emotional videos which were, respectively, neutral, joyful and sorrowful to evoke the corresponding emotions. They completed the "subjective emotion evaluation form" (SEEF) before watching each video (T0), immediately after watching the video (T1) and 15 min after watching the video (T2) to conduct subjective emotion evaluation. Simultaneously, their heart rate, galvanic skin response and heart rate variability were collected with a 16-lead physiological recorder to conduct an objective evaluation of emotional arousal. (2) Collection of pulse-graph parameters: pulse-graph parameters of the subjects at T0, T1 and T2 were collected with a pulse condition analyzer. When watching the joy video, the rapid ejection phase extended significantly, both the left ventricular diastole and the cardiac cycle shortened significantly. When watching the sorrow video, the left ventricular diastole extended significantly, the cardiac cycle showed an upward trend, and heart rate showed a downward trend. Joy and sorrow have a certain effect on pulse-graph parameters of the subjects. The mechanisms may be that joy contributes to rapid ejection phase extension and a shortening of the left ventricular diastole and the cardiac cycle, while sorrow extends the left ventricular diastole. According to the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the visceral functions can be mediated through human qi flow. Moderate joy and sorrow can promote, respectively, the smooth qi flow of the heart and the lung. However, excessive or long-term joy and sorrow can lead to disharmonious qi flow of the two viscera. Therefore, maintaining moderate emotions is beneficial to the physiological functions of the viscera. Great emotional fluctuations may damage the visceral functions. Future studies with effects of other emotions on pulse-graph parameters are warranted to determine the reliability of the association of emotions and pulse diagnosis.

Serotonin Syndrome: Prophylactic Treatment With Cyproheptadine. Despite the numerous advantages of linezolid therapy, one disadvantage continuing to hinder its use is the risk of serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents. Developing a better understanding of serotonin syndrome is essential for the prevention and management of this potentially life-threatening condition. This report describes a patient with schizophrenia, depression, and severe, acute osteomyelitis. The patient was taking multiple serotonergic agents and required the use of linezolid without the possibility of a sufficient washout period. The severity of the patient's condition in conjunction with increased risk for serotonin syndrome warranted prophylactic treatment with cyproheptadine. The complex pathophysiology of prophylactic treatment of serotonin syndrome with cyproheptadine is worthy of discussion.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through their interactions with the serotonergic system and the potential for serotonin syndrome.

Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases the levels of certain neurotransmitters, including serotonin, in the brain. Linezolid, an antibiotic, is also known to interact with the serotonergic system and can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when coadministered with other serotonergic agents.

The abstract "Serotonin Syndrome: Prophylactic Treatment With Cyproheptadine" highlights the risk of serotonin syndrome associated with linezolid therapy, particularly when used in combination with other serotonergic agents. This suggests that linezolid can affect the serotonergic system, potentially leading to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

Although there is no direct mention of dextroamphetamine in the abstracts, its mechanism of action as a serotonergic agent could potentially interact with linezolid, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome. This indirect relationship is based on the shared interaction with the serotonergic system, rather than a direct pharmacological interaction between the two substances.

The underlying mechanism of this potential indirect relationship involves the modulation of serotonin levels in the brain. Dextroamphetamine increases serotonin levels, while linezolid can also affect the serotonergic system, potentially leading to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic agents.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on their interactions with the serotonergic system, which could potentially increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when used together. This relationship is indirect, as there is no direct mention of dextroamphetamine in the abstracts, but it is plausible based on the mechanisms of action of both substances.

mRNA expression changes of slit proteins following peripheral nerve injury in the rat model. Slit family of proteins is one of the repulsive axonal guidance cues, and it also plays an important role in neuronal migration and branching through the interaction with roundabout receptors. The function and role of Slit family proteins during peripheral nerve regeneration are still unknown. We examined the expressions of Slits 1-3 mRNAs in the facial nerve nuclei after facial nerve transection by in situ hybridization, using Sprague-Dawley rats. Slit 1 mRNA was weakly expressed in the facial motoneurons, and its expression increased from day 5 to day 28 after transection, with the peak on day 14 after axotomy. Slits 2 and 3 mRNAs were expressed in the motoneurons of the facial nerve before injury, but the expression of Slit 2 mRNA was down-regulated from day 1 to day 7 after axotomy, with the peak on the first day after injury. Slit 3 mRNA expression in the axotomized side remained unchanged throughout the examination period. Slits 1 and 2 mRNA expression returned to the normal level on day 56 postoperatively. The difference in expression pattern of Slit family mRNA in the neurons during peripheral nerve regeneration suggests that it plays a different role in axonal regeneration after axotomy of peripheral nerves.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must first identify any potential connections between the two substances through intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the provided abstracts.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Serotonin Syndrome**: Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin levels in the brain. Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, it's known that dextroamphetamine, like other amphetamines, can have serotonergic effects.

2. **Linezolid and Serotonin Syndrome**: One of the abstracts explicitly mentions linezolid in the context of serotonin syndrome. Linezolid, an antibiotic, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when co-administered with other serotonergic agents.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be understood through their separate interactions with the serotonin system. Dextroamphetamine can increase serotonin levels, and linezolid, by inhibiting monoamine oxidase, can also increase serotonin levels. If a patient is taking dextroamphetamine and is then prescribed linezolid, there could be an increased risk of serotonin syndrome due to the combined effect of both drugs on serotonin levels.

4. **Underlying Mechanisms**: The underlying mechanism involves the serotonergic system. Both drugs can lead to increased serotonin levels, albeit through different mechanisms. Dextroamphetamine can directly increase the release of serotonin or inhibit its reuptake, while linezolid, as an MAOI, prevents the breakdown of serotonin, leading to its accumulation.

5. **Intermediate Entities or Processes**: The key intermediate entity in this relationship is the serotonergic system, specifically the regulation of serotonin levels in the brain. The process involves the pharmacological effects of both drugs on this system, leading to a potential increase in serotonin levels and the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In summary, while there is no direct mention of dextroamphetamine and linezolid together in the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred based on their effects on the serotonergic system. This relationship highlights the importance of careful consideration when prescribing medications that can affect serotonin levels to prevent adverse outcomes like serotonin syndrome.

Pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine addiction: an update. Methamphetamine dependence is a serious public health problem worldwide for which there are no approved pharmacological treatments. Psychotherapy is still the mainstay of treatment; however, relapse rates are high. The search for effective pharmacological treatment has intensified in the last decade. This review will highlight progress in pharmacological interventions to treat methamphetamine dependence as well as explore new pharmacological targets. Published data from clinical trials for stimulant addiction were searched using PubMed and summarized, as well as highlights from a recent symposium on methamphetamine pharmacotherapy presented at the ISAM 2006 meeting, including interim analysis data from an ongoing D-amphetamine study in Australia. Early pilot data are encouraging for administering D-amphetamine and methylphenidate as treatment for heavy amphetamine users. Abilify at 15 mg/day dose increased amphetamine use in an outpatient pilot study. Sertraline, ondansetron, baclofen, tyrosine, and imipramine were ineffective in proof-of-concept studies. Development of pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence is still in an early stage. Data suggesting D-amphetamine and methylphenidate as effective pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine addiction will need to be confirmed by larger trials. Preclinical data suggest that use of GVG, CB1 antagonist, and lobeline are also promising therapeutic strategies.

Modification of d-amphetamine-induced responses by baclofen in rats. d-Amphetamine is known to have effects on heart rate, body temperature and locomotor activity. However, it is not known if GABAB receptor stimulation modifies these actions of d-amphetamine. Using telemetry recordings, this study examined the interactions between the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen and d-amphetamine, on heart rate responses, body temperature and locomotor activity, and whether these effects could be blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist SCH 50911. Rats were prepared with telemetry implants, which allowed continuous monitoring of heart rate, core temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity. Drugs were subsequently administered subcutaneously to the animals for simultaneous recording over a period of 180 min. d-Amphetamine alone (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in heart rate, but was without any effect on body temperature, whilst at 1.0 mg/kg, it significantly increased locomotor activity. Baclofen increased heart rate without affecting locomotor activity, and, at the highest dose of 10.0 mg/kg, it induced a significant reduction in body temperature. Graded doses of baclofen (3.0-10.0 mg/kg), when co-administered with d-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg), did not modify the d-amphetamine-induced increase in heart rate, but the combination produced significant reductions of body temperature. The latter was only partially reversed by the GABAB receptor antagonist SCH 50911 (10.0 mg/kg). By contrast, the increase in locomotor activity by d-amphetamine was markedly blocked by baclofen in a dose-related manner, and this effect was abolished by SCH 50911 (10.0 mg/kg). SCH 50911 alone at doses of 3.0, 6.0 and 10.0 mg/kg had no effect on temperature or locomotor activity. Heart rate was increased significantly, but the magnitude of change was small. The results of the present study suggest that stimulation of GABAB receptors by baclofen completely blocks the locomotor stimulatory effects of d-amphetamine. Baclofen did not significantly modify the increase in heart rate produced by d-amphetamine and decreased body temperature, both alone and in combination with d-amphetamine. GABAB receptor ligands may well have potential as pharmacotherapies in the treatment of amphetamine abuse and dependence.

Interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and GABA-ergic drugs: clinical implications. Pretreatment (IP) of mice with (-) baclofen, muscimol, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (S,4-c) pyridin-3-ol hydrate (THIP), aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or gamma-acetylenic GABA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of thelocomotor stimulant effect of phencyclidine (PCP, 8 mg/kg). Although (-) baclofen was found to be the most effective PCP antagonist, its (+) isomer was inactive. The maximum blocking effect of AOAA was seen in animals treated 3 and 6 hr earlier. Except for gamma-acetylenic GABA, none of these drugs significantly blocked the locomotor stimulant effect of d-amphetamine (3 mg/kg, IP). Diazepam reduced d-amphetamine response, but failed to influence PCP-induced stimulation. The locomotor stimulant effect of PCP, unlike that of d-amphetamine, may be the result of a specific GABA antagonistic effect at certain dopamine-rich areas of the brain. It seems that (-) baclofen may prove to be useful in the management of PCP intoxication. Administration of higher doses of PCP (20 and 50 mg/kg) in mice pretreated with (-) baclofen resulted in the development of surgical anesthesia manifested as the loss of a) righting reflex, b) pain sensation and c) corneal reflex. The duration of the general anesthetic response was found to be a function of the doses of both (-) baclofen and PCP. The possible use of (-) baclofen as an adjuvant to general anesthetic is discussed.

No effects of anti-motion sickness drugs on vestibular evoked myogenic potentials outcome parameters. To investigate the effects of meclizine (50 mg), baclofen (10 mg), cinnarizine (20 mg) + dimenhydrinate (40 mg), and promethazine (25 mg) + dextro-amphetamine (5 mg) on the parameters of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test. Double-blind placebo-controlled prospective randomized trial. University hospital. Twenty-four (first block: baclofen versus placebo) and 20 healthy male subjects (second block: meclizine, cinnarizine + dimenhydrinate and promethazine + dextro-amphetamine versus placebo). VEMP test. Threshold, p13 and n23 latencies, p13-n23 latency difference, p13-n23 peak-to-peak amplitude, mean rectified voltage of the sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction and the corrected amplitude. There were no clinically significant pharmacologic effects on the VEMP outcome parameters. However, there was a statistically significant left-right asymmetry after intake of the combination promethazine + d-amphetamine for the parameters p13 and latency difference. The absence of clinically significant effects can be explained by the predominant presence of the target receptors for the applied drugs in the medial vestibular nucleus, which receives the lowest grade of saccular projections. It also can be hypothesized that the VEMP methodology and techniques in general do not allow determining pharmacologic effects in a healthy group of subjects because of a too small discriminative power. The left-right asymmetry can be explained by a depressive action of the drugs on the central compensation mechanisms. Because there were no significant differences between the VEMP parameters obtained after intake of the placebos of both blocks, we concluded that there were no training effects.

Evaluation of the effects of anti-motion sickness drugs on subjective sleepiness and cognitive performance of healthy males. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and cognitive side effects of baclofen (10 mg), meclizine (25 mg), dimenhydrinate (40 mg) plus cinnarizine (25 mg) and promethazine (25 mg) plus d-amphetamine (10 mg). The study had a double-blind, placebo controlled, repeated measures design and was conducted on healthy male volunteers. The psychomotor vigilance test, the Sternberg working memory task, the implicit memory test and the automated Operation Span (Ospan) task were performed. The Stanford, the Karolinska and the Epworth Sleepiness scale determined the degree of sleepiness. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) evaluated mood states and adverse effects were reported on a 22-item questionnaire. Letter recalls and time for solving mathematical problems, recorded during the Ospan task, were impaired by baclofen and dimenhydrinate-cinnarizine respectively, suggesting an influence of these drugs on the working memory. Significant side effects for baclofen were: sleepiness, tiredness, blurred vision, concentration problems and dizziness whereas for dimenhydrinate-cinnarizine only sleepiness and blurred vision were reported. Meclizine decreased the accuracy on the Sternberg working memory task and thus seemed to affect short-term memory. A reported side effect was increased sleepiness. Promethazine plus d-amphetamine did not affect any of the tested cognitive functions. However, many side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, insomnia and tremors were reported. The results show that meclizine and dimenhydrinate combined with cinnarizine were the two drugs with the most acceptable combination of side effects.

Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump. Case report. Infection of an intrathecal pump system is a rare but serious complication and usually leads to the removal of the pump. The authors report the first case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) meningitis in a patient with such a pump successfully treated with linezolid without the need for removal of the intrathecal pump. A 77-year-old woman with cervical myelopathy underwent implantation of an intrathecal pump system for baclofen administration. Two weeks after the procedure she developed meningitis caused by MRSA as isolated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, blood samples, and serum obtained from the pump pouch. Clinically she presented with meningism, somnolence, and signs of sepsis. When a combined intravenous antibiotic treatment regimen of vancomycin and rifampicin resulted in no clinical improvement, that regimen was discontinued and linezolid was administered intravenously as monotherapy. Within 3 days clinical and laboratory findings showed significant improvement. After 1 week of linezolid treatment, blood and CSF cultures were sterile. Intravenous treatment was administered for a total of 3 weeks, after which the patient was treated with oral linezolid for 3 months. During 18 months of follow-up, no new clinical or laboratory signs of infection were observed. These results confirm previous reports of the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of severe infections of the central nervous system caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, especially postneurosurgical infections.

Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour complicated by X chromosomal mosaicism. We describe a case of well-differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (SLCT) of the ovary. A 48-year-old Japanese woman had had symptoms of virilization, i.e. alopecia and facial hair, for 8 years. Although the patient had given birth to three normal children, laboratory investigations revealed an elevated serum level of free testosterone and tripartite mosaicism (45X/46XX/47XXX). Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumour of the left ovary. After oophorectomy, the serum level of free testosterone returned to the normal range and symptoms of virilization resolved. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient with SLCT who had tripartite mosaicism and had given birth to normal children. Although the aetiology of SLCT is not known, we believe that SLCT is associated with sex chromosomal abnormalities at least in some cases.

Automatic brain tissue extraction method using erosion-dilation treatment (BREED) from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted data. To improve the efficiency of brain image analysis, we propose a full-automatic method for extracting brain tissue from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging of T1-weighted data on the human head (brain tissue extraction method using erosion-dilation treatment [BREED]). The extraction processing is realized by combining signal intensity thresholding by means of the discriminant analysis method and an erosion-dilation treatment of the image. The accuracy of BREED is evaluated using both simulated and subject data. BREED can extract brain tissues with high accuracy (approximately 97%) for either simulated or subject data.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and look for connections between the two substances through intermediate entities or processes.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Baclofen**: The abstract "Modification of d-amphetamine-induced responses by baclofen in rats" shows that baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, can modify the effects of d-amphetamine. Specifically, baclofen blocks the locomotor stimulatory effects of d-amphetamine and affects body temperature when co-administered with d-amphetamine. This interaction suggests that baclofen can influence the pharmacological effects of dextroamphetamine.

2. **Baclofen and Linezolid**: The connection between baclofen and linezolid is found in the abstract "Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump." This case report mentions a patient who was being treated with baclofen administered through an intrathecal pump and developed MRSA meningitis, which was successfully treated with linezolid. Although this does not directly imply a pharmacological interaction between baclofen and linezolid, it establishes baclofen as a context in which linezolid's efficacy was demonstrated.

3. **Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be hypothesized through their separate interactions with baclofen. Dextroamphetamine's effects are modified by baclofen, and baclofen's administration context (intrathecal pump) is where linezolid showed efficacy in treating an infection. This does not imply a direct pharmacological interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid but suggests that in scenarios where baclofen is used (such as for treating spasticity or, as explored, in drug addiction contexts), the use of linezolid for infections might be relevant. The relationship is indirect because it involves considering how baclofen influences dextroamphetamine's effects and how linezolid is used in a medical context that might involve baclofen administration.

In summary, while there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid described in the abstracts, an indirect relationship can be proposed through their connections with baclofen. Baclofen modifies dextroamphetamine's effects, and linezolid has been used effectively in a context involving baclofen administration. This indirect link highlights the complexity of pharmacological interactions and the importance of considering the broader therapeutic context in which drugs are used.

Pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine addiction: an update. Methamphetamine dependence is a serious public health problem worldwide for which there are no approved pharmacological treatments. Psychotherapy is still the mainstay of treatment; however, relapse rates are high. The search for effective pharmacological treatment has intensified in the last decade. This review will highlight progress in pharmacological interventions to treat methamphetamine dependence as well as explore new pharmacological targets.

Differential Neural Responses Underlying the Inhibition of the Startle Response by Pre-Pulses or Gaps in Mice. Gap pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (GPIAS) is a behavioral paradigm used for inferring the presence of tinnitus in animal models as well as humans. In contrast to pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), the neural circuitry controlling GPIAS is poorly understood. To increase our knowledge on GPIAS, a comparative study with PPI was performed in mice combining these behavioral tests and c-Fos activity mapping in brain areas involved in the inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR). Both pre-pulses and gaps efficiently inhibited the ASR and abolished the induction of c-Fos in the pontine reticular nucleus. Differential c-Fos activation was found between PPI and GPIAS in the forebrain whereby PPI activated the lateral globus pallidus and GPIAS activated the primary auditory cortex. Thus, different neural maps are regulating the inhibition of the startle response by pre-pulses or gaps. To further investigate this differential response to PPI and GPIAS, we pharmacologically disrupted PPI and GPIAS with D-amphetamine or Dizocilpine (MK-801) to target dopamine efflux and to block NMDA receptors, respectively. Both D-amp and MK-801 efficiently decreased PPI and GPIAS. We administered Baclofen, an agonist GABAB receptor, but failed to detect any robust rescue of the effects of D-amp and MK-801 suggesting that PPI and GPIAS are GABAB-independent. These novel findings demonstrate that the inhibition of the ASR by pre-pulses or gaps is orchestrated by different neural pathways.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the provided abstracts. While there is no direct mention of an interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we can infer a potential indirect relationship through intermediate entities or processes.

Specifically, baclofen blocks the locomotor stimulatory effects of d-amphetamine. This interaction suggests that baclofen can influence the behavioral effects of d-amphetamine.

2. **Baclofen and Linezolid**: The abstract "Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump" mentions that the patient was receiving baclofen through an intrathecal pump system. Linezolid, an antibiotic, was used to treat the patient's MRSA meningitis without removing the pump. Although this abstract does not directly describe an interaction between baclofen and linezolid, it implies that baclofen and linezolid can coexist in a therapeutic context.

3. **Potential Indirect Relationship**: Considering the above points, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could exist through the intermediate entity of baclofen. If dextroamphetamine is being used to treat a condition, such as methamphetamine addiction, and baclofen is also being administered (e.g., for spasticity), the interaction between dextroamphetamine and baclofen could be relevant. In a scenario where a patient is receiving baclofen and develops an infection that requires linezolid treatment, the indirect relationship would involve the potential for linezolid to affect the patient's condition, which is being managed with baclofen and possibly dextroamphetamine.

The underlying mechanism of this indirect relationship would involve the modulation of GABAB receptors by baclofen, which in turn affects the behavioral responses to d-amphetamine. Linezolid, as an antibiotic, would not directly interact with dextroamphetamine or baclofen but could influence the patient's overall condition, potentially impacting the efficacy or required dosage of dextroamphetamine and baclofen.

In summary, while there is no direct relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, an indirect relationship could exist through the intermediate entity of baclofen, which interacts with dextroamphetamine and is used in a therapeutic context where linezolid might also be administered. This indirect relationship highlights the complexity of pharmacological interactions and the importance of considering all medications and therapies when treating patients.

Interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and GABA-ergic drugs: clinical implications. Pretreatment (IP) of mice with (-) baclofen, muscimol, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (S,4-c) pyridin-3-ol hydrate (THIP), aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or gamma-acetylenic GABA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of thelocomotor stimulant effect of phencyclidine (PCP, 8 mg/kg). Although (-) baclofen was found to be the most effective PCP antagonist, its (+) isomer was inactive. The maximum blocking effect of AOAA was seen in animals treated 3 and 6 hr earlier. Except for gamma-acetylenic GABA, none of these drugs significantly blocked the locomotor stimulant effect of d-amphetamine (3 mg/kg, IP). Diazepam reduced d-amphetamine response, but failed to influence PCP-induced stimulation. The locomotor stimulant effect of PCP, unlike that of d-amphetamine, may be the result of a specific GABA antagonistic effect at certain dopamine-rich areas of the brain. It seems that (-) baclofen may prove to be useful in the management of PCP intoxication. Administration of higher doses of PCP (20 and 50 mg/kg) in mice pretreated with (-) baclofen resulted in the development of surgical anesthesia manifested as the loss of a) righting reflex, b) pain sensation and c) corneal reflex. The duration of the general anesthetic response was found to be a function of the doses of both (-) baclofen and PCP. The possible use of (-) baclofen as an adjuvant to general anesthetic is discussed.

To investigate the effects of meclizine (50 mg), baclofen (10 mg), cinnarizine (20 mg) + dimenhydrinate (40 mg), and promethazine (25 mg) + dextro-amphetamine (5 mg) on the parameters of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test. Double-blind placebo-controlled prospective randomized trial. University hospital. Twenty-four (first block: baclofen versus placebo) and 20 healthy male subjects (second block: meclizine, cinnarizine + dimenhydrinate and promethazine + dextro-amphetamine versus placebo). VEMP test. Threshold, p13 and n23 latencies, p13-n23 latency difference, p13-n23 peak-to-peak amplitude, mean rectified voltage of the sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction and the corrected amplitude. There were no clinically significant pharmacologic effects on the VEMP outcome parameters. However, there was a statistically significant left-right asymmetry after intake of the combination promethazine + d-amphetamine for the parameters p13 and latency difference. The absence of clinically significant effects can be explained by the predominant presence of the target receptors for the applied drugs in the medial vestibular nucleus, which receives the lowest grade of saccular projections. It also can be hypothesized that the VEMP methodology and techniques in general do not allow determining pharmacologic effects in a healthy group of subjects because of a too small discriminative power. The left-right asymmetry can be explained by a depressive action of the drugs on the central compensation mechanisms. Because there were no significant differences between the VEMP parameters obtained after intake of the placebos of both blocks, we concluded that there were no training effects.

Differential Neural Responses Underlying the Inhibition of the Startle Response by Pre-Pulses or Gaps in Mice. Gap pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (GPIAS) is a behavioral paradigm used for inferring the presence of tinnitus in animal models as well as humans. In contrast to pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), the neural circuitry controlling GPIAS is poorly understood. To increase our knowledge on GPIAS, a comparative study with PPI was performed in mice combining these behavioral tests and c-Fos activity mapping in brain areas involved in the inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR). Both pre-pulses and gaps efficiently inhibited the ASR and abolished the induction of c-Fos in the pontine reticular nucleus. Differential c-Fos activation was found between PPI and GPIAS in the forebrain whereby PPI activated the lateral globus pallidus and GPIAS activated the primary auditory cortex. Thus, different neural maps are regulating the inhibition of the startle response by pre-pulses or gaps. To further investigate this differential response to PPI and GPIAS, we pharmacologically disrupted PPI and GPIAS with D-amphetamine or Dizocilpine (MK-801) to target dopamine efflux and to block NMDA receptors, respectively. Both D-amp and MK-801 efficiently decreased PPI and GPIAS. We administered Baclofen, an agonist GABAB receptor, but failed to detect any robust rescue of the effects of D-amp and MK-801 suggesting that PPI and GPIAS are GABAB-independent. These novel findings demonstrate that the inhibition of the ASR by pre-pulses or gaps is orchestrated by different neural pathways.

Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump. Case report. Infection of an intrathecal pump system is a rare but serious complication and usually leads to the removal of the pump. The authors report the first case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) meningitis in a patient with such a pump successfully treated with linezolid without the need for removal of the intrathecal pump. A 77-year-old woman with cervical myelopathy underwent implantation of an intrathecal pump system for baclofen administration. Two weeks after the procedure she developed meningitis caused by MRSA as isolated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, blood samples, and serum obtained from the pump pouch. Clinically she presented with meningism, somnolence, and signs of sepsis. When a combined intravenous antibiotic treatment regimen of vancomycin and rifampicin resulted in no clinical improvement, that regimen was discontinued and linezolid was administered intravenously as monotherapy. Within 3 days clinical and laboratory findings showed significant improvement. After 1 week of linezolid treatment, blood and CSF cultures were sterile. Intravenous treatment was administered for a total of 3 weeks, after which the patient was treated with oral linezolid for 3 months. During 18 months of follow-up, no new clinical or laboratory signs of infection were observed. These results confirm previous reports of the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of severe infections of the central nervous system caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, especially postneurosurgical infections.

Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour complicated by X chromosomal mosaicism. We describe a case of well-differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (SLCT) of the ovary. A 48-year-old Japanese woman had had symptoms of virilization, i.e. alopecia and facial hair, for 8 years. Although the patient had given birth to three normal children, laboratory investigations revealed an elevated serum level of free testosterone and tripartite mosaicism (45X/46XX/47XXX). Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumour of the left ovary. After oophorectomy, the serum level of free testosterone returned to the normal range and symptoms of virilization resolved. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient with SLCT who had tripartite mosaicism and had given birth to normal children. Although the aetiology of SLCT is not known, we believe that SLCT is associated with sex chromosomal abnormalities at least in some cases.

Automatic brain tissue extraction method using erosion-dilation treatment (BREED) from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted data. To improve the efficiency of brain image analysis, we propose a full-automatic method for extracting brain tissue from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging of T1-weighted data on the human head (brain tissue extraction method using erosion-dilation treatment [BREED]). The extraction processing is realized by combining signal intensity thresholding by means of the discriminant analysis method and an erosion-dilation treatment of the image. The accuracy of BREED is evaluated using both simulated and subject data. BREED can extract brain tissues with high accuracy (approximately 97%) for either simulated or subject data.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and look for connections between the two substances through intermediate entities or processes.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Baclofen**: The first connection can be made through baclofen. In the abstract "Interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and GABA-ergic drugs: clinical implications," it's mentioned that baclofen, a GABA-ergic drug, can inhibit the locomotor stimulant effect of phencyclidine (PCP) but not that of d-amphetamine. However, in the context of treating methamphetamine addiction, as discussed in "Pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine addiction: an update," dextroamphetamine is explored as a potential treatment. Baclofen is also mentioned in this context as ineffective in proof-of-concept studies for treating methamphetamine addiction.

2. **Baclofen and Linezolid**: The connection between baclofen and linezolid can be inferred from the case report "Successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis using linezolid without removal of intrathecal infusion pump." In this report, a patient with an intrathecal pump system for baclofen administration developed MRSA meningitis, which was successfully treated with linezolid. This shows that in a clinical setting, linezolid can be used to treat infections in patients who are on baclofen therapy, establishing an indirect link between the use of baclofen and the potential need for linezolid in cases of infection.

3. **Dextroamphetamine, Baclofen, and Neural Pathways**: Further insight into the relationship between dextroamphetamine and baclofen can be gained from "Differential Neural Responses Underlying the Inhibition of the Startle Response by Pre-Pulses or Gaps in Mice." This study shows that d-amphetamine affects neural pathways related to the startle response, which can be modulated by various pharmacological agents, including those acting on GABA receptors like baclofen. Although baclofen did not rescue the effects of d-amphetamine in this specific study, it highlights the complex interplay between different neurotransmitter systems in the brain.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be described as follows: Dextroamphetamine is being explored as a treatment for methamphetamine addiction, and its effects are studied in the context of various neurotransmitter systems. Baclofen, a GABA-ergic drug, is used in certain neurological conditions and has been studied for its interactions with other substances, including its lack of effect on d-amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation. Linezolid, an antibiotic, is used to treat infections such as MRSA meningitis, which can occur in patients receiving baclofen through an intrathecal pump. Therefore, while dextroamphetamine and linezolid do not have a direct pharmacological interaction, they can be indirectly linked through the clinical contexts in which they are used, particularly in relation to baclofen therapy and the management of infections in patients with neurological conditions.

Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between dextroamphetamine and linezolid.

Pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine addiction: an update. Methamphetamine dependence is a serious public health problem worldwide for which there are no approved pharmacological treatments. Psychotherapy is still the mainstay of treatment; however, relapse rates are high. The search for effective pharmacological treatment has intensified in the last decade. This review will highlight progress in pharmacological interventions to treat methamphetamine dependence as well as explore new pharmacological targets. Published data from clinical trials for stimulant addiction were searched using PubMed and summarized, as well as highlights from a recent symposium on methamphetamine pharmacotherapy presented at the ISAM 2006 meeting, including interim analysis data from an ongoing D-amphetamine study in Australia. Early pilot data are encouraging for administering D-amphetamine and methylphenidate as treatment for heavy amphetamine users. Abilify at 15 mg/day dose increased amphetamine use in an outpatient pilot study. Sertraline, ondansetron, baclofen, tyrosine, and imipramine were ineffective in proof-of-concept studies. Development of pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence is still in an early stage. Data suggesting D-amphetamine and methylphenidate as effective pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine addiction will need to be confirmed by larger trials. Preclinical data suggest that use of GVG, CB1 antagonist, and lobeline are also promising therapeutic strategies.

Interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and GABA-ergic drugs: clinical implications. Pretreatment (IP) of mice with (-) baclofen, muscimol, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (S,4-c) pyridin-3-ol hydrate (THIP), aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or gamma-acetylenic GABA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of thelocomotor stimulant effect of phencyclidine (PCP, 8 mg/kg). Although (-) baclofen was found to be the most effective PCP antagonist, its (+) isomer was inactive. The maximum blocking effect of AOAA was seen in animals treated 3 and 6 hr earlier. Except for gamma-acetylenic GABA, none of these drugs significantly blocked the locomotor stimulant effect of d-amphetamine (3 mg/kg, IP). Diazepam reduced d-amphetamine response, but failed to influence PCP-induced stimulation. The locomotor stimulant effect of PCP, unlike that of d-amphetamine, may be the result of a specific GABA antagonistic effect at certain dopamine-rich areas of the brain. It seems that (-) baclofen may prove to be useful in the management of PCP intoxication. Administration of higher doses of PCP (20 and 50 mg/kg) in mice pretreated with (-) baclofen resulted in the development of surgical anesthesia manifested as the loss of a) righting reflex, b) pain sensation and c) corneal reflex. The duration of the general anesthetic response was found to be a function of the doses of both (-) baclofen and PCP. The possible use of (-) baclofen as an adjuvant to general anesthetic is discussed.

No effects of anti-motion sickness drugs on vestibular evoked myogenic potentials outcome parameters. To investigate the effects of meclizine (50 mg), baclofen (10 mg), cinnarizine (20 mg) + dimenhydrinate (40 mg), and promethazine (25 mg) + dextro-amphetamine (5 mg) on the parameters of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test.

There were no clinically significant pharmacologic effects on the VEMP outcome parameters. However, there was a statistically significant left-right asymmetry after intake of the combination promethazine + d-amphetamine for the parameters p13 and latency difference. The absence of clinically significant effects can be explained by the predominant presence of the target receptors for the applied drugs in the medial vestibular nucleus, which receives the lowest grade of saccular projections. It also can be hypothesized that the VEMP methodology and techniques in general do not allow determining pharmacologic effects in a healthy group of subjects because of a too small discriminative power. The left-right asymmetry can be explained by a depressive action of the drugs on the central compensation mechanisms. Because there were no significant differences between the VEMP parameters obtained after intake of the placebos of both blocks, we concluded that there were no training effects.

Automatic diagnosis of strict left bundle branch block using a wavelet-based approach. Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) are known to have a good clinical response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, the high number of false positive diagnosis obtained with the conventional LBBB criteria limits the effectiveness of this therapy, which has yielded to the definition of new stricter criteria. They require prolonged QRS duration, a QS or rS pattern in the QRS complexes at leads V1 and V2 and the presence of mid-QRS notch/slurs in 2 leads within V1, V2, V5, V6, I and aVL. The aim of this work was to develop and assess a fully-automatic algorithm for strict LBBB diagnosis based on the wavelet transform. Twelve-lead, high-resolution, 10-second ECGs from 602 patients enrolled in the MADIT-CRT trial were available. Data were labelled for strict LBBB by 2 independent experts and divided into training (n = 300) and validation sets (n = 302) for assessing algorithm performance. After QRS detection, a wavelet-based delineator was used to detect individual QRS waves (Q, R, S), QRS onsets and ends, and to identify the morphological QRS pattern on each standard lead. Then, multilead QRS boundaries were defined in order to compute the global QRS duration. Finally, an automatic algorithm for notch/slur detection within the QRS complex was applied based on the same wavelet approach used for delineation. In the validation set, LBBB was diagnosed with a sensitivity and specificity of Se = 92.9% and Sp = 65.1% (Acc = 79.5%, PPV = 74% and NPV = 89.6%). The results confirmed that diagnosis of strict LBBB can be done based on a fully automatic extraction of temporal and morphological QRS features. However, it became evident that consensus in the definition of QRS duration as well as notch and slurs definitions is necessary in order to guarantee accurate and repeatable diagnosis of complete LBBB.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must first identify any common intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the provided abstracts. Unfortunately, linezolid is not mentioned in any of the abstracts. However, we can attempt to establish a connection through the underlying mechanisms and intermediate entities mentioned.

One possible indirect relationship involves the following steps:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and dopamine**: Dextroamphetamine is known to increase dopamine levels in the brain. In the abstract "Differential Neural Responses Underlying the Inhibition of the Startle Response by Pre-Pulses or Gaps in Mice," it is mentioned that D-amphetamine targets dopamine efflux.
2. **Dopamine and GABA**: The interaction between dopamine and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) systems is well-established. In the abstract "Interaction between phencyclidine (PCP) and GABA-ergic drugs: clinical implications," it is discussed how GABA-ergic drugs can modulate the effects of PCP, which has some similarities to dopamine in terms of its stimulant effects.
3. **GABA and linezolid**: Linezolid, an antibiotic, has been reported to have some interactions with the GABA system, although this is not mentioned in the provided abstracts. However, it is known that linezolid can cause serotonin syndrome, a condition that can also involve GABAergic mechanisms.

While this connection is highly speculative and indirect, it illustrates a possible pathway:

Dextroamphetamine → Dopamine → GABA system → Potential interaction with linezolid (through GABA or related mechanisms)

Please note that this relationship is highly hypothetical and based on incomplete information. The actual connection between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, if any, may be entirely different and requires further research to establish.

In summary, without direct information about linezolid in the provided abstracts, we can only speculate about potential indirect relationships through intermediate entities like dopamine and GABA. Further research is necessary to determine any actual connections between dextroamphetamine and linezolid.

Two unusual cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Two cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are presented. A 27-year-old woman presented with peripherally located targetoid plaques, papules, blisters and lip erosions which began 9 days after 'recreational' use of 'speed' (dexamphetamine and ephedrine) consistent with erythema multiforme major. Three days later she developed widespread lesions with large areas of blistering affecting 40% of body surface area. The diagnosis was revised to TEN. Intravenous cyclosporin led to rapid prevention of new blister formation. A 71-year-old woman, 3 months after commencing amiodarone, developed extensive erythema, blistering and erosions affecting 50% of body surface area, with a maculopapular rash affecting the limbs and extremities consistent with a diagnosis of TEN. She developed septicaemia following bilateral pneumonia with pleural effusions and died 7 days after admission.

Magnesium chloride tetrahydrate, MgCl2.4H2O. The title compound, MgCl(2).4H(2)O, was crystallized at 403 K and its structure determined at 200 K. The structure is built up from MgCl(2)(H(2)O)(4) octahedra with a trans configuration. Each complex is situated on a crystallographic twofold axis, with the rotation axis aligned along one H(2)O-Mg-OH(2) axis. They are connected by a complex network of O-H...Cl hydrogen bonds. The structure contains two-dimensional sections that are essentially identical to those in the reported tetrahydrates of CrCl(2), FeCl(2), FeBr(2) and CoBr(2), but they are stacked in a different manner in MgCl(2).4H(2)O compared with the transition metal structures.

Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is related to the level of central arousal: effect of sleep deprivation on the association of high-frequency waking electroencephalogram with cortisol release. The temporal and quantitative interrelationships between the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and the level of central arousal were studied in 10 healthy young men during daytime wakefulness. Two experimental sessions were conducted randomly between 09.00 and 18.00 h, once after nocturnal sleep and once after a night of total sleep deprivation. Spectral analysis of serial waking electroencephalography (EEG) from a short target fixation task repeated every 10 min was undertaken, along with an estimation of cortisol secretory profiles by deconvolution of plasma radioimmunoassay measures obtained from continuous blood withdrawal with regular sampling at a 10-min interval. Following nocturnal sleep, a temporal association between the HPA axis activity and the waking EEG activity was found, cortisol secretory rate following changes in frontal gamma (20-45 Hz) band power by 10 min (average R = 0.458, p < 0.001). Although it remained significant (average R = 0.276, p < 0.05), the association strength decreased significantly following total sleep deprivation (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Cortisol plasma level, secretory rate and pulse amplitude were increased as well as waking EEG power in the delta (0.5-5.5 Hz), theta (5.5-8.5 Hz) and gamma frequency bands (all p values <0.05, Student t tests). The sleep deprivation-related increases in cortisol secretory rate and waking EEG gamma activity were quantitatively associated (R = 0.504, p < 0.05). These results support the existence of a common ultradian regulatory mechanism, co-ordinating HPA axis activity to the level of central arousal in man, which seems involved in the sleep deprivation-induced hyper-arousal.

Cardiac dysautonomia in leprosy. Responses to various tests of cardiovascular reflexes were studied in 15 patients with leprosy. Heart rate was continuously monitored by electrocardiogram and blood pressure was recorded simultaneously. Three patients showed evidence of cardiac dysautonomia, showing involvement of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. These three patients belonged to the bacilliferous group.

Light dosimetry in optical phantoms and in tissues: I. Multiple flux and transport theory. This is the first of two papers on the quantitative measurement of light energy fluence rates in optical phantoms and in tissues, in vitro and in vivo. The theory discussed in the present paper will be used in a forthcoming experimental paper to quantitatively check measurements of light energy fluence rates. A simple multiple flux model, which is equivalent to the diffusion approximation, is derived from the equation of transfer in a plane as well as in a spherical geometry. The equations obtained are similar to those of the Kubelka-Munk and related heuristic models. This permits conclusions regarding the limitations of these models and the values of their constants. The heuristic models are equivalent to diffusion theory for diffuse incident light, but not for collimated incident light. We also present a simple calculation of the radiance as a function of direction in the diffusion domain. This, together with the effective attenuation coefficient, permits indirect experimental determination of both the albedo and the anisotropy factor (g) of the scattering function. Similarity relations are discussed, as they result from the so called delta-Eddington approximation, leading to the conclusion that far from boundaries and sources light propagation characteristics do not change very much when g and omega s are varied, provided omega s (1-g) is kept constant (omega s = scattering coefficient). Therefore, only two optical constants are required to approximately describe light propagation in homogeneous and isotropic media in the diffusion approximation.

Linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis in a kidney-transplant patient. Linezolid is a recent oral antibiotic used in drug-resistant Gram-positive cocci infections. Herein, we report on the first case of linezolid-related acute renal failure in a kidney-transplant patient. A 60-year-old male having autosomic polycystic kidney disease with liver involvement, on cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil and very low dose prednisolone, presented with an Enterococcus faecium abscess of a huge liver cyst, which was treated by percutaneous drainage and linezolid therapy. Eight days after starting linezolid, he presented with acute renal failure, i.e. serum creatinine increased from 136- 221 micromol/l, associated with mild hypereosinophilia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There was no skin rash, arthralgia, eosinophiluria or proteinuria. The transplant kidney biopsy, performed 15 days after the beginning of linezolid therapy, showed interstitial nephritis and focal tubular atrophy. After linezolid withdrawal and increasing prednisolone daily dose to 20 mg/d, within a few days, serum creatinine had decreased; after 2 and 4 weeks post linezolid withdrawal, his serum creatinine was 166 and 159 micromol/l, respectively. Because of the potential side effects of linezolid, i.e. myelosuppression and possibly nephrotoxicity, we recommend close monitoring of these parameters when linezolid therapy is attempted in kidney transplant patients.

Solid-state carrier-envelope-phase noise measurements with intrinsically balanced detection. We use interference between single- and two-photon photocurrent generation pathways in a semiconductor to measure the out-of-loop carrier-envelope-phase noise of a stabilized Ti:sapphire modelocked laser. This solid-state measurement technique exhibits no significant amplitude/phase coupling, adds no measurable phase noise compared to the standard self-referencing technique, and requires few optical components. The method features a built-in balanced detection mechanism that is particularly appealing for dc carrier-envelope-phase measurements.

Randomised controlled trial of allopurinol prophylaxis in very preterm infants. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (an enzyme capable of generating superoxide radicals following hypoxiaischaemia), was investigated in preterm infants to determine its ability to prevent the complications of neonatal intensive care which may be associated with oxidative injury. Four hundred infants of between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to receive enteral allopurinol (20 mg/ml) or an equivalent dose of placebo for seven daily doses. At admission, plasma hypoxanthine concentrations were significantly higher in infants who subsequently developed periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), but there was no difference in the primary endpoint (PVL) between the treated and control groups. The failure of allopurinol prophylaxis in this group of infants is probably related to the complex nature of the pathological processes and to the timing of treatment. If oxidant injury is an important mechanism of cellular injury in these preterm infants, an alternative biochemical modulator would be required, or a combination of agents might be effective.

Implant supported fixed distal extension prostheses. The distal extension fixed implant supported prosthesis is now available as an alternative to a partial denture. However, not all patients will be suitable for such treatment. Limitations imposed on fixture length, the effect of gape upon instrumentation, the size of abutment components and the design of the superstructure are discussed in this article, to assist the general practitioner in case referral.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the potential intermediate entities or processes that could connect these two substances. Although the provided abstracts do not directly link dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we can propose a hypothetical connection through the concepts of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the potential for drug interactions affecting kidney function or immune response.

1. **Stress and HPA Axis Activation**: The abstract on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity relates to the level of central arousal, indicating that stress (such as sleep deprivation) can activate the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol release. Dextroamphetamine, a stimulant, could potentially induce stress or increase central arousal, thereby activating the HPA axis.

2. **Immune System Modulation**: Activation of the HPA axis and the subsequent release of cortisol can modulate the immune system. Cortisol is known to suppress the immune system, which could potentially affect the body's response to infections or the efficacy of antibiotics, including linezolid.

3. **Kidney Function and Drug Interactions**: The case report on linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis highlights the potential nephrotoxicity of linezolid, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues or those on other medications that could interact with linezolid. Dextroamphetamine might not directly interact with linezolid, but if it affects blood pressure or heart rate significantly, it could potentially influence kidney function, especially in vulnerable individuals.

4. **Indirect Relationship Hypothesis**: An indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could exist through the modulation of the immune system and kidney function. If dextroamphetamine use leads to increased stress and activation of the HPA axis, this could result in immune system suppression. Simultaneously, if an individual is taking linezolid for an infection, the suppressed immune state might affect the drug's efficacy or increase the risk of side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, especially if kidney function is already compromised or if other medications are being used that could exacerbate these effects.

In conclusion, while the abstracts do not provide a direct link between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, an indirect relationship could be hypothesized through the effects of dextroamphetamine on stress levels, immune system modulation, and potential impacts on kidney function, all of which could influence the efficacy and safety profile of linezolid. This relationship is highly speculative and would require specific research to confirm any potential interactions or effects.

Two unusual cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Two cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are presented. A 27-year-old woman presented with peripherally located targetoid plaques, papules, blisters and lip erosions which began 9 days after 'recreational' use of 'speed' (dexamphetamine and ephedrine) consistent with erythema multiforme major. Three days later she developed widespread lesions with large areas of blistering affecting 40% of body surface area. The diagnosis was revised to TEN. Intravenous cyclosporin led to rapid prevention of new blister formation. A 71-year-old woman, 3 months after commencing amiodarone, developed extensive erythema, blistering and erosions affecting 50% of body surface area, with a maculopapular rash affecting the limbs and extremities consistent with a diagnosis of TEN. She developed septicaemia following bilateral pneumonia with pleural effusions and died 7 days after admission.

Magnesium chloride tetrahydrate, MgCl2.4H2O. The title compound, MgCl(2).4H(2)O, was crystallized at 403 K and its structure determined at 200 K. The structure is built up from MgCl(2)(H(2)O)(4) octahedra with a trans configuration. Each complex is situated on a crystallographic twofold axis, with the rotation axis aligned along one H(2)O-Mg-OH(2) axis. They are connected by a complex network of O-H...Cl hydrogen bonds. The structure contains two-dimensional sections that are essentially identical to those in the reported tetrahydrates of CrCl(2), FeCl(2), FeBr(2) and CoBr(2), but they are stacked in a different manner in MgCl(2).4H(2)O compared with the transition metal structures.

Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is related to the level of central arousal: effect of sleep deprivation on the association of high-frequency waking electroencephalogram with cortisol release. The temporal and quantitative interrelationships between the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and the level of central arousal were studied in 10 healthy young men during daytime wakefulness. Two experimental sessions were conducted randomly between 09.00 and 18.00 h, once after nocturnal sleep and once after a night of total sleep deprivation. Spectral analysis of serial waking electroencephalography (EEG) from a short target fixation task repeated every 10 min was undertaken, along with an estimation of cortisol secretory profiles by deconvolution of plasma radioimmunoassay measures obtained from continuous blood withdrawal with regular sampling at a 10-min interval. Following nocturnal sleep, a temporal association between the HPA axis activity and the waking EEG activity was found, cortisol secretory rate following changes in frontal gamma (20-45 Hz) band power by 10 min (average R = 0.458, p < 0.001). Although it remained significant (average R = 0.276, p < 0.05), the association strength decreased significantly following total sleep deprivation (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Cortisol plasma level, secretory rate and pulse amplitude were increased as well as waking EEG power in the delta (0.5-5.5 Hz), theta (5.5-8.5 Hz) and gamma frequency bands (all p values <0.05, Student t tests). The sleep deprivation-related increases in cortisol secretory rate and waking EEG gamma activity were quantitatively associated (R = 0.504, p < 0.05). These results support the existence of a common ultradian regulatory mechanism, co-ordinating HPA axis activity to the level of central arousal in man, which seems involved in the sleep deprivation-induced hyper-arousal.

Cardiac dysautonomia in leprosy. Responses to various tests of cardiovascular reflexes were studied in 15 patients with leprosy. Heart rate was continuously monitored by electrocardiogram and blood pressure was recorded simultaneously. Three patients showed evidence of cardiac dysautonomia, showing involvement of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. These three patients belonged to the bacilliferous group.

[Initial treatment strategy for classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults].  Four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy IFRT (ISRT) is a standard regimen, as an initial treatment, for patients with early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), whereas 2 cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT (ISRT) is an alternative regimen for those with favorable early-stage cHL.  For patients with unfavorable early-stage cHL including bulky disease, local radiotherapy can be safely omitted if negative findings on interim PET are obtained after 2 cycles of escalated BEACOPP plus 2 cycles of ABVD.  ABVD (6/8 cycles) or brentuximab vedotin (BV) with concurrent AVD (6 cycles) is a standard regimen for patients with advanced-stage cHL.  For elderly cHL patients (60 years of age or older) and multiple comorbidities, the risk of treatment-related adverse events is higher, which can potentially lead to poor outcomes.  BV with sequential AVD therapy, which is a unique combination strategy, has been developed for elderly cHL patients.  The combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies with AVD therapies is currently being evaluated in some clinical trials.  This review includes current evidence that primarily focuses on randomized clinical trials for newly diagnosed adult cHL patients and management points in clinical practice for those patients. 

Linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis in a kidney-transplant patient. Linezolid is a recent oral antibiotic used in drug-resistant Gram-positive cocci infections. Herein, we report on the first case of linezolid-related acute renal failure in a kidney-transplant patient. A 60-year-old male having autosomic polycystic kidney disease with liver involvement, on cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil and very low dose prednisolone, presented with an Enterococcus faecium abscess of a huge liver cyst, which was treated by percutaneous drainage and linezolid therapy. Eight days after starting linezolid, he presented with acute renal failure, i.e. serum creatinine increased from 136- 221 micromol/l, associated with mild hypereosinophilia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There was no skin rash, arthralgia, eosinophiluria or proteinuria. The transplant kidney biopsy, performed 15 days after the beginning of linezolid therapy, showed interstitial nephritis and focal tubular atrophy. After linezolid withdrawal and increasing prednisolone daily dose to 20 mg/d, within a few days, serum creatinine had decreased; after 2 and 4 weeks post linezolid withdrawal, his serum creatinine was 166 and 159 micromol/l, respectively. Because of the potential side effects of linezolid, i.e. myelosuppression and possibly nephrotoxicity, we recommend close monitoring of these parameters when linezolid therapy is attempted in kidney transplant patients.

Solid-state carrier-envelope-phase noise measurements with intrinsically balanced detection. We use interference between single- and two-photon photocurrent generation pathways in a semiconductor to measure the out-of-loop carrier-envelope-phase noise of a stabilized Ti:sapphire modelocked laser. This solid-state measurement technique exhibits no significant amplitude/phase coupling, adds no measurable phase noise compared to the standard self-referencing technique, and requires few optical components. The method features a built-in balanced detection mechanism that is particularly appealing for dc carrier-envelope-phase measurements.

Randomised controlled trial of allopurinol prophylaxis in very preterm infants. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (an enzyme capable of generating superoxide radicals following hypoxiaischaemia), was investigated in preterm infants to determine its ability to prevent the complications of neonatal intensive care which may be associated with oxidative injury. Four hundred infants of between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to receive enteral allopurinol (20 mg/ml) or an equivalent dose of placebo for seven daily doses. At admission, plasma hypoxanthine concentrations were significantly higher in infants who subsequently developed periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), but there was no difference in the primary endpoint (PVL) between the treated and control groups. The failure of allopurinol prophylaxis in this group of infants is probably related to the complex nature of the pathological processes and to the timing of treatment. If oxidant injury is an important mechanism of cellular injury in these preterm infants, an alternative biochemical modulator would be required, or a combination of agents might be effective.

Implant supported fixed distal extension prostheses. The distal extension fixed implant supported prosthesis is now available as an alternative to a partial denture. However, not all patients will be suitable for such treatment. Limitations imposed on fixture length, the effect of gape upon instrumentation, the size of abutment components and the design of the superstructure are discussed in this article, to assist the general practitioner in case referral.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the potential intermediate entities or processes that could connect these two substances. Based on the provided abstracts, a possible indirect linkage can be proposed through the following narrative:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Stress Response**: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant that can affect the central nervous system, potentially altering the body's stress response. The abstract on "Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is related to the level of central arousal" suggests that central arousal, which can be influenced by stimulants like dextroamphetamine, is associated with the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress, regulating the release of cortisol and other hormones.

2. **Stress Response and Immune System**: The activation of the HPA axis and the subsequent release of cortisol can have immunomodulatory effects. Chronic or excessive stress, potentially induced by stimulant use, can suppress or alter the immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections.

3. **Infections and Linezolid Use**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Individuals with compromised immune systems, possibly due to chronic stress or other factors, may be more prone to such infections, thereby increasing the likelihood of linezolid prescription.

4. **Linezolid Side Effects and Organ Dysfunction**: The abstract on "Linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis in a kidney-transplant patient" highlights a rare but serious side effect of linezolid—renal toxicity. This suggests that linezolid, while effective against certain infections, can have significant adverse effects on organ function, particularly in vulnerable populations like kidney transplant patients.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be hypothesized as follows: The use of dextroamphetamine may contribute to an altered stress response, potentially weakening the immune system. A compromised immune system increases the risk of infections that may require treatment with antibiotics like linezolid. The use of linezolid, in turn, carries risks of side effects such as renal toxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing organ dysfunction. Thus, while dextroamphetamine and linezolid are not directly related in terms of their pharmacological mechanisms, their use can be indirectly linked through the broader context of stress, immune response, infection risk, and the consequent need for antibiotic treatment.

Based on the provided abstracts, a possible indirect linkage can be proposed through the concept of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the immune system.

1. **Dextroamphetamine and Stress**: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant that can increase alertness and energy. Its use, especially in a recreational context as mentioned in one of the abstracts, can lead to increased stress levels. Stress activates the HPA axis, leading to the release of cortisol and other hormones.

2. **HPA Axis and Immune System**: The activation of the HPA axis and the subsequent release of cortisol have a suppressive effect on the immune system. Chronic or acute stress can impair immune function, making an individual more susceptible to infections.

3. **Infections and Linezolid**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. Individuals with compromised immune systems due to stress or other factors may be more prone to such infections, necessitating the use of antibiotics like linezolid.

4. **Potential for Indirect Relationship**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be mediated through the stress response and its impact on the immune system. The use of dextroamphetamine could lead to increased stress, which in turn could weaken the immune system, making a person more susceptible to infections that might require treatment with linezolid.

This narrative connects the elements of stress, immune suppression, and susceptibility to infections as a potential pathway through which dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be indirectly related. However, it's crucial to note that this relationship is speculative and based on the general principles of pharmacology, immunology, and the effects of stimulants on the body, rather than direct evidence from the provided abstracts.

ABVD (6/8 cycles) or brentuximab vedotin (BV) with concurrent AVD (6 cycles) is a standard regimen for patients with advanced-stage cHL.  For elderly cHL patients (60 years of age or older) and multiple comorbidities, the risk of treatment-related adverse events is higher, which can potentially lead to poor outcomes.  BV with sequential AVD therapy, which is a unique combination strategy, has been developed for elderly cHL patients.  The combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies with AVD therapies is currently being evaluated in some clinical trials.  This review includes current evidence that primarily focuses on randomized clinical trials for newly diagnosed adult cHL patients and management points in clinical practice for those patients. 

Linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis in a kidney-transplant patient. Linezolid is a recent oral antibiotic used in drug-resistant Gram-positive cocci infections. Herein, we report on the first case of linezolid-related acute renal failure in a kidney-transplant patient. A 60-year-old male having autosomic polycystic kidney disease with liver involvement, on cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil and very low dose prednisolone, presented with an Enterococcus faecium abscess of a huge liver cyst, which was treated by percutaneous drainage and linezolid therapy. Eight days after starting linezolid, he presented with acute renal failure, i.e. serum creatinine increased from 136- 221 micromol/l, associated with mild hypereosinophilia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There was no skin rash, arthralgia, eosinophiluria or proteinuria. The transplant kidney biopsy, performed 15 days after the beginning of linezolid therapy, showed interstitial nephritis and focal tubular atrophy. After linezolid withdrawal and increasing prednisolone daily dose to 20 mg/d, within a few days, serum creatinine had decreased; after 2 and 4 weeks post linezolid withdrawal, his serum creatinine was 166 and 159 micromol/l, respectively. Because of the potential side effects of linezolid, i.e. myelosuppression and possibly nephrotoxicity, we recommend close monitoring of these parameters when linezolid therapy is attempted in kidney transplant patients.

When to buy a practice--how to do it right!

Randomised controlled trial of allopurinol prophylaxis in very preterm infants. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (an enzyme capable of generating superoxide radicals following hypoxiaischaemia), was investigated in preterm infants to determine its ability to prevent the complications of neonatal intensive care which may be associated with oxidative injury. Four hundred infants of between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to receive enteral allopurinol (20 mg/ml) or an equivalent dose of placebo for seven daily doses. At admission, plasma hypoxanthine concentrations were significantly higher in infants who subsequently developed periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), but there was no difference in the primary endpoint (PVL) between the treated and control groups. The failure of allopurinol prophylaxis in this group of infants is probably related to the complex nature of the pathological processes and to the timing of treatment. If oxidant injury is an important mechanism of cellular injury in these preterm infants, an alternative biochemical modulator would be required, or a combination of agents might be effective.

Studies in the Epidemiology of Plague in H. E. H. the Nizam's Dominions: Comparison of Certain Factors in a Plague-Infected Place with That of Neighbouring Plague-Free Area.

In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathic Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to roxithromycin and erythromycin. The in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of roxithromycin and erythromycin against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were evaluated. Sixty-seven different A. actinomycetemcomitans isolated from periodontal pockets of 101 subjects with different forms of early-onset and adult periodontitis and three reference strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 29522, ATCC 29523, and NCTC 9710) were included in this study. Erythromycin showed poor in vitro activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans; roxithromycin, on the contrary, exhibited good in vitro activity. Moreover, roxithromycin showed the best in vitro antimicrobial activity against 17 serotype a and 12 serotype c subpopulations of A. actinomycetemcomitans; against 38 serotype b subpopulation of A. actinomycetemcomitans, roxithromycin was consistently active. Roxithromycin exhibited MBC values usually equal to, or one-fold higher than MIC values. All the MBC values of erythromycin were three- to four-fold higher than the respective MIC result. Since roxithromycin is characterized by high concentrations in serum and good penetration and diffusion into gingival tissue, it could be expected to pass into the gingival crevicular fluid at levels sufficiently high to inhibit A. actinomycetemcomitans in vivo. These data indicate that roxithromycin might be a potential candidate for therapeutic trials in patients with A. actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the potential intermediate entities or processes that could connect these two substances. The provided abstracts do not directly link dextroamphetamine and linezolid, but we can attempt to establish a connection through the concepts and mechanisms discussed.

1. **Stress and the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis**: The abstract on the HPA axis activity and its relation to the level of central arousal provides a starting point. Dextroamphetamine, a stimulant, can increase central arousal and potentially affect the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol levels. Elevated cortisol levels can have various systemic effects, including impacts on the immune system and potentially on drug metabolism or efficacy.

2. **Immune System Modulation and Infections**: The connection to the immune system is crucial because linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. If dextroamphetamine use leads to increased stress and cortisol levels, it could theoretically modulate the immune response, making an individual more susceptible to infections that linezolid would be used to treat.

3. **Kidney Function and Drug Clearance**: The abstract on linezolid-induced interstitial nephritis highlights the potential nephrotoxicity of linezolid. Dextroamphetamine, through its effects on blood pressure and potentially on kidney function (especially with chronic use or in susceptible individuals), could theoretically influence the clearance of linezolid, affecting its plasma levels and increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity.

4. **Central Nervous System Effects and Drug Interactions**: Both dextroamphetamine and linezolid can have central nervous system (CNS) effects. Dextroamphetamine is a CNS stimulant, and linezolid has been associated with CNS effects such as serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with other serotonergic agents. While there's no direct interaction mentioned, the potential for additive or synergistic CNS effects if these drugs are used concurrently could be a concern.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could be hypothesized through several mechanisms:
- **Increased susceptibility to infections** due to immune system modulation by dextroamphetamine, potentially leading to a greater need for antibiotics like linezolid.
- **Effects on kidney function** that could influence linezolid clearance and increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.
- **Potential for CNS interactions** if these drugs are used together, given their individual effects on the central nervous system.

These connections are speculative and based on the general principles of pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology discussed in the abstracts. Direct evidence of an interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid would require specific studies investigating their combined use.

A randomized double-blind trial of paroxetine and/or dextroamphetamine and problem-focused therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults. To determine the effect of psychotherapy, dextroamphetamine, and/or paroxetine on attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) in adults. Ninety-eight adults with DSM-IV ADHD were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy and dextroamphetamine, paroxetine, both, or placebo for 20 weeks. A 2 x 2 factorial design compared patients who received dextroamphetamine versus no dextroamphetamine with patients who received paroxetine versus no paroxetine. Data were collected from August 2000 until May 2002. One half of the 98 enrolled subjects were found to have at least 1 lifetime mood or anxiety disorder on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Sixty percent of patients who received medication and 80% of those who received placebo completed the 5-month trial. ADHD symptoms were significantly (p = .012) lower in patients in the completer group who received dextroamphetamine. Paroxetine had no effect on ADHD. Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Depression (HAM-D) scores were low to start, and no treatment differences were evident at endpoint. Significantly (p < .001) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as ADHD responders if they received dextroamphetamine (85.7%) or combined treatment (66.7%) versus paroxetine (20.0%) or placebo (21.1%). Significantly (p = .003) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as mood/anxiety responders if they received paroxetine (100%) or combined treatment (73.3%) versus those receiving dextroamphetamine (57.15%) or placebo (47.4%). Clinicians rated any patient who received medication and psychological therapy as significantly more improved overall than those who received placebo and psychological therapy (intent to treat: p = .033; completers: p = .001). ADHD symptoms improved with dextroamphetamine. Mood and internalizing symptoms were seen as improved with paroxetine by clinicians, despite absence of response on the HAM-A and HAM-D. The presence of a lifetime internalizing disorder attenuated the response to dextroamphetamine. Patients who received both dextroamphetamine and paroxetine had more severe adverse events but did not show greater improvement overall than patients treated with 1 medication.

Rivastigmine-induced dystonia. A case of acute dystonia related to rivastigmine use is reported. A 61-year-old Caucasian woman who had suffered from bipolar II disorder with rapid cycling for over 30 years was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit. In addition to bipolar II disorder, the patient had been previously diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various anxiety disorders. During the current hospitalization, she was taking clonazepam, dextroamphetamine, lamotrigine, lansoprazole, levothyroxine, memantine, quetiapine, risperidone, rivastigmine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, and zolpidem. Soon after hospital admission, she began to complain of a tightening in her chest. A review of her records revealed similar complaints during previous hospitalizations. Rivastigmine was discontinued due to concerns of interactions with her antipsychotic regimen. Although these symptoms were previously attributed to anxiety, they appeared worse during this hospitalization. During these events she would be witnessed lying in bed in a supine position with her head canted posteriorly. Benztropine was given to help determine if she was having a dystonic reaction. Within 30 minutes, her chest discomfort began to resolve, and her symptoms resolved completely over the next 48 hours. Three days later, rivastigmine was restarted by the attending psychiatrist because of concerns about the patient's memory, and the dystonia-like symptoms returned within 2 hours of her morning dose. Rivastigmine was discontinued, and benztropine was given and then discontinued, with no return of symptoms for the remainder of her two-week hospitalization. A patient with bipolar II disorder and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease developed dystonia, possibly caused by rivastigmine. However, the patient was taking various other medications that could have lowered the threshold for extrapyramidal syndromes.

Pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents: focus on guidelines for the primary care practitioner. This article is a practical review of the current psychopharmacological agents used in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and pemoline are effective in the control of symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The controlled release preparations and the adjunctive use of clonidine are helpful to extend stimulant effects and control adverse effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in individual cases of child and adolescent depression, but adverse effects may limit their use. Clomipramine has been found to be effective for childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder. Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be safer for depression and are also useful in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Buspirone is effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children. Newer atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone may have less limiting adverse effects than older antipsychotics in the treatment of psychosis and severe behaviour disorders, but the physician must be vigilant for the emergence of tardive dyskinesia. Drug treatment in children and adolescents must take into account the child's environmental influences and be part of an overall treatment plan where individual, familial and cultural issues are addressed.

Clinical assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that frequently persists into adulthood, with significant levels of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behavior. Impairments associated with adult ADHD include distress from the symptoms, impaired ability to function in work and academic settings, and problems sustaining stable relationships. The disorder is commonly associated with volatile moods, antisocial behavior, and drug and alcohol misuse. There is an increased risk of developing comorbid anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and drug and alcohol dependence. Despite the proven effectiveness of drugs such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and atomoxetine, few cases of ADHD are recognized and treated in the UK. The reasons for this are unclear, since most psychiatrists working with children and adolescents are aware that ADHD commonly persists into adult life and they also see the disorder affecting parents of children with ADHD. Issues of transition from the care of child to adult psychiatry and the need to refer adult relatives of children with ADHD to suitable psychiatric services are a major concern. Furthermore, many cases of adult ADHD go unrecognized or are seen by mental health teams that are not familiar with the subtleties of the adult presentation. As a result, misdiagnosis and treatment for conditions such as atypical depression, mixed affective disorder, cyclothymia, and borderline and unstable emotional personality disorders is not uncommon. There is therefore a requirement for further training in this area. This review will describe the common clinical presentation and provide guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Any psychiatrically trained physician using standard psychiatric assessment procedures can perform clinical evaluations for adult ADHD. As with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood, ADHD has its own characteristic onset, course and psychopathology. Symptoms of ADHD are trait-like, being stable characteristics from early childhood, and commonly co-occur with affective instability. Stimulants are the mainstay of treatment and are effective in around 70% of cases. Psychotherapeutic interventions also have an important role. These guidelines will assist psychiatrists and other adult mental health workers in identifying and treating individuals with adult ADHD.

Free-operant avoidance behavior by rats after reinforcer revaluation using opioid agonists and D-amphetamine. The associative processes that support free-operant instrumental avoidance behavior are still unknown. We used a revaluation procedure to determine whether the performance of an avoidance response is sensitive to the current value of the aversive, negative reinforcer. Rats were trained on an unsignaled, free-operant lever press avoidance paradigm in which each response avoided or escaped shock and produced a 5 s feedback stimulus. The revaluation procedure consisted of noncontingent presentations of the shock in the absence of the lever either paired or unpaired with systemic morphine and in a different cohort with systemic d-amphetamine. Rats were then tested drug free during an extinction test. In both the d-amphetamine and morphine groups, pairing of the drug and shock decreased subsequent avoidance responding during the extinction test, suggesting that avoidance behavior was sensitive to the current incentive value of the aversive negative reinforcer. Experiment 2 used central infusions of D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the periacqueductal gray and nucleus accumbens shell to revalue the shock. Infusions of DAMGO in both regions replicated the effects seen with systemic morphine. These results are the first to demonstrate the impact of revaluation of an aversive reinforcer on avoidance behavior using pharmacological agents, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of avoidance behavior symptomatic of anxiety disorders.

Matching the bipolar patient and the mood stabilizer. Bipolar disorder poses many treatment challenges, including "matching" a particular patient with the optimal treatment regimen. Although there are a number of extant guidelines to assist the clinician in selecting treatment, these recommendations are largely based on general variables and fail to take into account the subtleties and complications that confront a clinician in practice. An analysis of predictors of medication response in bipolar disorder provides a basis for matching patients with optimal medication regimens. Response to treatment may depend on the polarity of an episode or on clinical features such as mixed or psychotic symptomatology and rate of cycling. Comorbid psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder should also be considered in designing a treatment regimen. Similarly, medical conditions, especially metabolic abnormalities or kidney insufficiency, must be taken into account. Selection of medication may also involve an analysis of demographic factors, including family and personal history of response to a particular agent. When selecting the most appropriate mood stabilizer for a patient--particularly when polypharmacy is required--the clinician should keep potential side effects and drug interactions in mind. Randomized, controlled studies in bipolar populations are needed to further characterize optimal matching of patient and medication.

Moclobemide: therapeutic use and clinical studies. Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine-oxidase-A (RIMA) and has been extensively evaluated in the treatment of a wide spectrum of depressive disorders and less extensively studied in anxiety disorders. Nearly all meta-analyses and most comparative studies indicated that in the acute management of depression this drug is more efficacious than placebo and as efficacious as tricyclic (or some heterocyclic) antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is a growing evidence that moclobemide is not inferior to other antidepressants in the treatment of subtypes of depression, such as dysthymia, endogenous (unipolar and bipolar), reactive, atypical, agitated, and retarded depression as with other antidepressants limited evidence suggests that moclobemide has consistent long-term efficacy. However, more controlled studies addressing this issue are needed. For patients with bipolar depression the risk of developing mania seems to be not higher with moclobemide than with other antidepressants. The effective therapeutic dose range for moclobemide in most acute phase trials was 300 to 600 mg, divided in 2 to 3 doses. While one controlled trial and one long-term open-label study found moclobemide to be efficacious in social phobia, three controlled trials subsequently revealed either no effect or less robust effects with the tendency of higher doses (600 - 900 mg/d) to be more efficacious. Two comparative trials demonstrated moclobemide to be as efficacious as fluoxetine or clomipramine in patients suffering from panic disorder. Placebo-controlled trials in this indication are, however, still lacking. A relationship between the plasma concentration of moclobemide and its therapeutic efficacy is not apparent but a positive correlation with adverse events has been found. Dizziness, nausea and insomnia occurred more frequently on moclobemide than on placebo. Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants. Gastrointestinal side effects and, especially, sexual dysfunction were much less frequent with moclobemide than with SSRIs. Unlike irreversible MAO-inhibitors, moclobemide has a negligible propensity to induce hypertensive crisis after ingestion of tyramine-rich food ("cheese-reaction"). Therefore, dietary restrictions are not as strict. However, with moclobemide doses above 900 mg/d the risk of interaction with ingested tyramine might become clinically relevant. After multiple dosing the oral bioavailability of moclobemide reaches almost 100%. At therapeutic doses, moclobemide lacks significant negative effects on psychomotor performance, cognitive function or cardiovascular system. Due to the relative freedom from these side effects, moclobemide is particularly attractive in the treatment of elderly patients. Moclobemide is a substrate of CYP2C19. Although it acts as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, relatively few clinically important drug interactions involving moclobemide have been reported. It is relatively safe even in overdose. The drug has a short plasma elimination half-life that allows switching to an alternative agent within 24 h. Since it is well tolerated, therapeutic doses can often be reached rapidly upon onset of treatment. Steady-state plasma levels are reached approximately at one week following dose adjustment. Patients with renal dysfunction require no dose reduction in contrast to patients with severe hepatic impairment. Cases of refractory depression might improve with a combination of moclobemide with other antidepressants, such as clomipramine or a SSRI. Since this combination has rarely been associated with a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome, it requires lower entry doses, a slower dose titration and a more careful monitoring of patients. Combination therapy with moclobemide and other serotonergic agents, or opioids, should be undertaken with caution, although no serious adverse events have been published with therapeutic doses of moclobemide to date. On the basis of animal data the combined use of moclobemide with pethidine or dextropropoxyphene should be avoided. There is no evidence that moclobemide would increase body weight or produce seizures. Some preclinical data suggest that moclobemide may have anticonvulsant property.

Citalopram--a review of pharmacological and clinical effects. To provide clinicians with a critical evaluation of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available in Canada since March 1999. Commercial searches (MEDLINE and BiblioTech) and an "in-house" search (InfoDrug) were used to find published English-language references for clinical and preclinical publications. There was no restriction of publication dates. Primary index terms used were: pharmacological properties, receptors, pharmacological selectivity, pharmacokinetics, age-related pharmacokinetics, sex-related pharmacokinetics, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, cytochrome activity, drug interactions, adverse reactions, antidepressant switching, precautions, overdose, drug discontinuation, children, geriatric, depression, combination therapy, placebo control, refractory depression, anxiety disorders and medical disorders. A total of 74 studies were reviewed. Twenty-one of these studies specifically examined the clinical efficacy and tolerability of citalopram in depressive disorders as well as other disorders. In depressive disorders, clinical studies were required to have either placebo or active comparison controls for a minimum of 3 weeks. For other disorders, in the absence of double-blind trials, open-label studies were included. Pharmacological studies were limited to animal studies focusing on citalopram's selectivity and receptor specificity, and positron emission tomography studies were incorporated to include human pharmacological data. Pharmacokinetic studies focused on the metabolism, safety and tolerability of citalopram, specifically with reference to adverse reactions, drug interactions and overdose in addition to citalopram's effect on vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. Data on clinical studies were summarized according to test measures, study duration and outcome of study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were summarized according to properties and interactions. Adverse reactions were extracted to outline citalopram's safety profile. Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant with a more specific and selective pharmacological profile than other antidepressants of its class. It is well tolerated, and drug interactions are not a significant concern. It is also reasonably safe for populations vulnerable to pharmacokinetic effects, such as the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. In addition to its tolerability, citalopram is effective in the treatment of major depression, other depressive disorders and panic disorder. It has the potential to effectively treat other anxiety disorders and substance-use disorders; in addition, it may be useful in several medical conditions. There is evidence to support the role of citalopram as a well-tolerated and effective SSRI antidepressant. There is a need for further evaluation of its role in psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder.

The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders. Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.

Wisdom of the CROUD:  Development and validation of a patient-level prediction model for opioid use disorder using population-level claims data. Some patients who are given opioids for pain could develop opioid use disorder. If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their first opioid. A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424 patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365 days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score, derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15-29, medical history of substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for predicting opioid use disorder. CROUD could be used by clinicians to obtain personalized risk scores. CROUD could be used to further educate those at higher risk and to personalize new opioid dispensing guidelines such as urine testing. Due to the high false positive rate, it should not be used for contraindication or to restrict utilization.

When fever is more than infection: two cases of vancomycin-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, but serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction associated with a range of medications. We present two cases of vancomycin-induced DRESS, which occurred simultaneously in the orthopaedic ward in an outer metropolitan hospital. These cases demonstrate the complexity in the diagnosis and management of this inflammatory syndrome on the background of known infection as well as evidence for linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin. The first case was managed conservatively, but developed progressive renal and liver injury along with demonstrated cytomegalovirus reactivation and recurrent colitis, and was eventually palliated. The second was commenced on intravenous glucocorticoids and achieved remission, although had ongoing renal dysfunction at the time of discharge from outpatient follow-up.

Population pharmacokinetics and toxicodynamics of continuously infused linezolid in critically ill patients.  Linezolid is a treatment option against multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.  Continuous infusion of linezolid has been proposed to optimize antimicrobial exposure, although pharmacokinetic data from large patient cohorts are lacking.  Population pharmacokinetics and the time-dependent association between linezolid exposure and the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in 120 critically ill patients were described.  Monte Carlo simulations evaluated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/toxicodynamic target attainment in relation to body weight and creatinine clearance for continuously infused doses of 300-2400 mg/day.  Linezolid pharmacokinetics were highly variable (interindividual variability of clearance: 52.8% coefficient of variation).  Non-linear clearance was quantified, which decreased from 6.82 to 3.82 L/h within 3-6 days in the population.  A relationship between linezolid exposure and platelet count over time was established.  For standard dosing (1200 mg/day), the model predicted Grade 2, 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (<75 * 103/uL, <50 * 103/uL and <25 * 103/uL) in 21.7%, 10.4% and 2.5% of patients at day 14, respectively.  Patients with impaired renal function displayed higher risk.  The overall probability of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia could be reduced from 10.4% using standard dosing to 6.3% if a linezolid steady state plasma concentration of 7 mg/L is targeted, suggesting a value of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).  Dosing linezolid by continuous infusion should include considerations of creatinine clearance and body weight to maximize the achievement of therapeutic exposures.  However, due to the high variability in individual dose, optimization using TDM seems necessary to optimize linezolid dosing under continuous infusion to avoid toxicity, particularly if longer treatment courses are expected. 

Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in impaired renal function: is it time for a dose adjustment? A case report and review of literature. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), but the incidence of drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) is not well defined. We investigate linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with impaired renal function. Since recent studies suggest that linezolid clearance is reduced in these patients and there are no precise data confirming that dose-adjustment should be required, we performed a systematic analysis in order to establish whether it is necessary to consider a dose adjustment and promote studies to confirm this concept. We report a case of thrombocytopenia (nadir 32 * 10(3)/mul) in a patient with acute kidney injury who was treated with linezolid for a MRSA pulmonary infection. We performed a systematic review of the literature through PubMed with the aim to include every case report, case series, prospective and retrospective clinical study reporting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia with concomitant impaired renal function. An increasing number of clinical studies suggest a correlation between the onset of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of platelet count and hemoglobin is recommended in patients treated with linezolid, especially in those with impaired renal function because the reduction of its clearance causes drug accumulation, as some studies have reported. Clinicians should consider the potential risk of this complication, especially in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease. Further studies should be encouraged to determine if the incidence of linezolid-related thrombocytopenia could be reduced by a dose adjustment according to renal function, for which currently there is still no specific recommendation.

Linezolid. Multiple antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in hospitals. Problem organisms include multiply resistant strains of pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci; for many of these the glycopeptide vancomycin has become the treatment of last resort. This situation has been made worse by the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. Fortunately, several compounds active against resistant Gram-positive bacteria are in active development. One of these is linezolid, the first of the oxazolidinones, a new class of antibacterial. Linezolid is a synthetic agent which is active against all the clinically important Gram-positive bacteria, including multiply resistant strains. It has good pharmacokinetics, with equal bioavailability by both oral and intravenous routes and no need for dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. The drug has a good safety profile and clinical trials have given excellent results in a variety of skin and soft tissue, respiratory and bloodstream infections. Linezolid is a promising drug, which, together with prudent antibiotic use and the prevention and control of hospital infection, will help in the battle against multiply antibiotic resistant Gram-positive bacteria.

Impact of administration of vancomycin or linezolid to critically ill patients with impaired renal function. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vancomycin (VAN) versus linezolid (LZD) on renal function in patients with renal failure (RF) admitted to intensive care units. This was a multicenter, retrospective, comparative cohort study. Renal failure patients were treated with VAN or LZD for proven or suspected infections by multiresistant Gram-positive cocci. Changes in plasma creatinine levels and creatinine clearance at the start and end of treatment were used as endpoints. A total of 147 patients were treated with VAN (group A, n = 68) or LZD (group B, n = 79). Group B included more patients with diabetes mellitus [9 (13.2%) vs. 25 (31.6%); p = 0.007], septic shock [39 (57.4%) vs. 60 (75.9%); p = 0.013] and greater RF (mean ClCr 42.24 ml/min vs. 37.57 ml/min; p = 0.04). Renal function improved in patients from both groups who did not require renal replacement therapy. A greater improvement was seen in group B [percent decrease in Cr (27.94 vs. 9.48; p = 0.02) and percent increase in ClCr (95.96 vs. 55.06; p = 0.05)]. In group A, nine patients (13.2%) experienced an antibiotic-related increase in RF, and antibiotic was discontinued in five patients due to adverse effects. It is reasonable to avoid use of VAN in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through several intermediate entities or processes. Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and ADHD**: Dextroamphetamine is used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patients with ADHD often have comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance abuse.
2. **Comorbidities and infections**: Individuals with ADHD and comorbidities may be more susceptible to infections, which can lead to the use of antibiotics like linezolid.
3. **Linezolid and Gram-positive bacteria**: Linezolid is an antibiotic effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is often used in critically ill patients or those with impaired renal function.
4. **Renal function and medication interactions**: Patients with impaired renal function may require dose adjustments for certain medications, including linezolid. Dextroamphetamine, although not directly interacting with linezolid, may be used in patients with ADHD who also have renal impairment or are taking other medications that interact with linezolid.
5. **Psychiatric comorbidities and medication use**: The presence of psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety or mood disorders, may influence the choice of medications, including antibiotics like linezolid. For example, patients with anxiety disorders may be more likely to receive linezolid due to its anxiolytic effects or may be more susceptible to linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.
6. **Thrombocytopenia and platelet count monitoring**: Linezolid can cause thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Monitoring platelet counts is essential in these patients. Dextroamphetamine, although not directly related to thrombocytopenia, may be used in patients who require platelet count monitoring due to other medications or medical conditions.
7. **Vancomycin and linezolid**: Vancomycin is another antibiotic that can be used to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections. However, vancomycin-induced DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome is a rare but serious side effect. Linezolid may be considered as an alternative to vancomycin in patients who develop DRESS syndrome.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid may exist through the following pathways:

* Dextroamphetamine is used to treat ADHD, which often co-occurs with other psychiatric comorbidities.
* These comorbidities may increase the risk of infections, leading to the use of antibiotics like linezolid.
* Linezolid is used to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections, particularly in critically ill patients or those with impaired renal function.
* Patients with impaired renal function may require dose adjustments for linezolid, and dextroamphetamine may be used in patients with ADHD who also have renal impairment or are taking other medications that interact with linezolid.
* The presence of psychiatric comorbidities may influence the choice of medications, including antibiotics like linezolid, and may increase the risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.

While there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, the complex relationships between ADHD, psychiatric comorbidities, infections, and medication use create an indirect link between these two medications.

Consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and any intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. Your explanation should connect these elements to form a coherent narrative that illustrates the possible indirect linkage between dextroamphetamine and linezolid.

A randomized double-blind trial of paroxetine and/or dextroamphetamine and problem-focused therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults. To determine the effect of psychotherapy, dextroamphetamine, and/or paroxetine on attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) in adults. Ninety-eight adults with DSM-IV ADHD were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy and dextroamphetamine, paroxetine, both, or placebo for 20 weeks. A 2 x 2 factorial design compared patients who received dextroamphetamine versus no dextroamphetamine with patients who received paroxetine versus no paroxetine. Data were collected from August 2000 until May 2002. One half of the 98 enrolled subjects were found to have at least 1 lifetime mood or anxiety disorder on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Sixty percent of patients who received medication and 80% of those who received placebo completed the 5-month trial. ADHD symptoms were significantly (p = .012) lower in patients in the completer group who received dextroamphetamine. Paroxetine had no effect on ADHD. Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Depression (HAM-D) scores were low to start, and no treatment differences were evident at endpoint. Significantly (p < .001) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as ADHD responders if they received dextroamphetamine (85.7%) or combined treatment (66.7%) versus paroxetine (20.0%) or placebo (21.1%). Significantly (p = .003) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as mood/anxiety responders if they received paroxetine (100%) or combined treatment (73.3%) versus those receiving dextroamphetamine (57.15%) or placebo (47.4%). Clinicians rated any patient who received medication and psychological therapy as significantly more improved overall than those who received placebo and psychological therapy (intent to treat: p = .033; completers: p = .001). ADHD symptoms improved with dextroamphetamine. Mood and internalizing symptoms were seen as improved with paroxetine by clinicians, despite absence of response on the HAM-A and HAM-D. The presence of a lifetime internalizing disorder attenuated the response to dextroamphetamine. Patients who received both dextroamphetamine and paroxetine had more severe adverse events but did not show greater improvement overall than patients treated with 1 medication.

Rivastigmine-induced dystonia. A case of acute dystonia related to rivastigmine use is reported. A 61-year-old Caucasian woman who had suffered from bipolar II disorder with rapid cycling for over 30 years was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit. In addition to bipolar II disorder, the patient had been previously diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various anxiety disorders. During the current hospitalization, she was taking clonazepam, dextroamphetamine, lamotrigine, lansoprazole, levothyroxine, memantine, quetiapine, risperidone, rivastigmine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, and zolpidem. Soon after hospital admission, she began to complain of a tightening in her chest. A review of her records revealed similar complaints during previous hospitalizations. Rivastigmine was discontinued due to concerns of interactions with her antipsychotic regimen. Although these symptoms were previously attributed to anxiety, they appeared worse during this hospitalization. During these events she would be witnessed lying in bed in a supine position with her head canted posteriorly. Benztropine was given to help determine if she was having a dystonic reaction. Within 30 minutes, her chest discomfort began to resolve, and her symptoms resolved completely over the next 48 hours. Three days later, rivastigmine was restarted by the attending psychiatrist because of concerns about the patient's memory, and the dystonia-like symptoms returned within 2 hours of her morning dose. Rivastigmine was discontinued, and benztropine was given and then discontinued, with no return of symptoms for the remainder of her two-week hospitalization. A patient with bipolar II disorder and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease developed dystonia, possibly caused by rivastigmine. However, the patient was taking various other medications that could have lowered the threshold for extrapyramidal syndromes.

Pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents: focus on guidelines for the primary care practitioner. This article is a practical review of the current psychopharmacological agents used in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and pemoline are effective in the control of symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The controlled release preparations and the adjunctive use of clonidine are helpful to extend stimulant effects and control adverse effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in individual cases of child and adolescent depression, but adverse effects may limit their use. Clomipramine has been found to be effective for childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder. Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be safer for depression and are also useful in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Buspirone is effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children. Newer atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone may have less limiting adverse effects than older antipsychotics in the treatment of psychosis and severe behaviour disorders, but the physician must be vigilant for the emergence of tardive dyskinesia. Drug treatment in children and adolescents must take into account the child's environmental influences and be part of an overall treatment plan where individual, familial and cultural issues are addressed.

Clinical assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that frequently persists into adulthood, with significant levels of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behavior. Impairments associated with adult ADHD include distress from the symptoms, impaired ability to function in work and academic settings, and problems sustaining stable relationships. The disorder is commonly associated with volatile moods, antisocial behavior, and drug and alcohol misuse. There is an increased risk of developing comorbid anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and drug and alcohol dependence. Despite the proven effectiveness of drugs such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and atomoxetine, few cases of ADHD are recognized and treated in the UK. The reasons for this are unclear, since most psychiatrists working with children and adolescents are aware that ADHD commonly persists into adult life and they also see the disorder affecting parents of children with ADHD. Issues of transition from the care of child to adult psychiatry and the need to refer adult relatives of children with ADHD to suitable psychiatric services are a major concern. Furthermore, many cases of adult ADHD go unrecognized or are seen by mental health teams that are not familiar with the subtleties of the adult presentation. As a result, misdiagnosis and treatment for conditions such as atypical depression, mixed affective disorder, cyclothymia, and borderline and unstable emotional personality disorders is not uncommon. There is therefore a requirement for further training in this area. This review will describe the common clinical presentation and provide guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Any psychiatrically trained physician using standard psychiatric assessment procedures can perform clinical evaluations for adult ADHD. As with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood, ADHD has its own characteristic onset, course and psychopathology. Symptoms of ADHD are trait-like, being stable characteristics from early childhood, and commonly co-occur with affective instability. Stimulants are the mainstay of treatment and are effective in around 70% of cases. Psychotherapeutic interventions also have an important role. These guidelines will assist psychiatrists and other adult mental health workers in identifying and treating individuals with adult ADHD.

Free-operant avoidance behavior by rats after reinforcer revaluation using opioid agonists and D-amphetamine. The associative processes that support free-operant instrumental avoidance behavior are still unknown. We used a revaluation procedure to determine whether the performance of an avoidance response is sensitive to the current value of the aversive, negative reinforcer. Rats were trained on an unsignaled, free-operant lever press avoidance paradigm in which each response avoided or escaped shock and produced a 5 s feedback stimulus. The revaluation procedure consisted of noncontingent presentations of the shock in the absence of the lever either paired or unpaired with systemic morphine and in a different cohort with systemic d-amphetamine. Rats were then tested drug free during an extinction test. In both the d-amphetamine and morphine groups, pairing of the drug and shock decreased subsequent avoidance responding during the extinction test, suggesting that avoidance behavior was sensitive to the current incentive value of the aversive negative reinforcer. Experiment 2 used central infusions of D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the periacqueductal gray and nucleus accumbens shell to revalue the shock. Infusions of DAMGO in both regions replicated the effects seen with systemic morphine. These results are the first to demonstrate the impact of revaluation of an aversive reinforcer on avoidance behavior using pharmacological agents, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of avoidance behavior symptomatic of anxiety disorders.

Matching the bipolar patient and the mood stabilizer. Bipolar disorder poses many treatment challenges, including "matching" a particular patient with the optimal treatment regimen. Although there are a number of extant guidelines to assist the clinician in selecting treatment, these recommendations are largely based on general variables and fail to take into account the subtleties and complications that confront a clinician in practice. An analysis of predictors of medication response in bipolar disorder provides a basis for matching patients with optimal medication regimens. Response to treatment may depend on the polarity of an episode or on clinical features such as mixed or psychotic symptomatology and rate of cycling. Comorbid psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder should also be considered in designing a treatment regimen. Similarly, medical conditions, especially metabolic abnormalities or kidney insufficiency, must be taken into account. Selection of medication may also involve an analysis of demographic factors, including family and personal history of response to a particular agent. When selecting the most appropriate mood stabilizer for a patient--particularly when polypharmacy is required--the clinician should keep potential side effects and drug interactions in mind. Randomized, controlled studies in bipolar populations are needed to further characterize optimal matching of patient and medication.

Moclobemide: therapeutic use and clinical studies. Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine-oxidase-A (RIMA) and has been extensively evaluated in the treatment of a wide spectrum of depressive disorders and less extensively studied in anxiety disorders. Nearly all meta-analyses and most comparative studies indicated that in the acute management of depression this drug is more efficacious than placebo and as efficacious as tricyclic (or some heterocyclic) antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is a growing evidence that moclobemide is not inferior to other antidepressants in the treatment of subtypes of depression, such as dysthymia, endogenous (unipolar and bipolar), reactive, atypical, agitated, and retarded depression as with other antidepressants limited evidence suggests that moclobemide has consistent long-term efficacy. However, more controlled studies addressing this issue are needed. For patients with bipolar depression the risk of developing mania seems to be not higher with moclobemide than with other antidepressants. The effective therapeutic dose range for moclobemide in most acute phase trials was 300 to 600 mg, divided in 2 to 3 doses. While one controlled trial and one long-term open-label study found moclobemide to be efficacious in social phobia, three controlled trials subsequently revealed either no effect or less robust effects with the tendency of higher doses (600 - 900 mg/d) to be more efficacious. Two comparative trials demonstrated moclobemide to be as efficacious as fluoxetine or clomipramine in patients suffering from panic disorder. Placebo-controlled trials in this indication are, however, still lacking. A relationship between the plasma concentration of moclobemide and its therapeutic efficacy is not apparent but a positive correlation with adverse events has been found. Dizziness, nausea and insomnia occurred more frequently on moclobemide than on placebo. Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants. Gastrointestinal side effects and, especially, sexual dysfunction were much less frequent with moclobemide than with SSRIs. Unlike irreversible MAO-inhibitors, moclobemide has a negligible propensity to induce hypertensive crisis after ingestion of tyramine-rich food ("cheese-reaction"). Therefore, dietary restrictions are not as strict. However, with moclobemide doses above 900 mg/d the risk of interaction with ingested tyramine might become clinically relevant. After multiple dosing the oral bioavailability of moclobemide reaches almost 100%. At therapeutic doses, moclobemide lacks significant negative effects on psychomotor performance, cognitive function or cardiovascular system. Due to the relative freedom from these side effects, moclobemide is particularly attractive in the treatment of elderly patients. Moclobemide is a substrate of CYP2C19. Although it acts as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, relatively few clinically important drug interactions involving moclobemide have been reported. It is relatively safe even in overdose. The drug has a short plasma elimination half-life that allows switching to an alternative agent within 24 h. Since it is well tolerated, therapeutic doses can often be reached rapidly upon onset of treatment. Steady-state plasma levels are reached approximately at one week following dose adjustment. Patients with renal dysfunction require no dose reduction in contrast to patients with severe hepatic impairment. Cases of refractory depression might improve with a combination of moclobemide with other antidepressants, such as clomipramine or a SSRI. Since this combination has rarely been associated with a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome, it requires lower entry doses, a slower dose titration and a more careful monitoring of patients. Combination therapy with moclobemide and other serotonergic agents, or opioids, should be undertaken with caution, although no serious adverse events have been published with therapeutic doses of moclobemide to date. On the basis of animal data the combined use of moclobemide with pethidine or dextropropoxyphene should be avoided. There is no evidence that moclobemide would increase body weight or produce seizures. Some preclinical data suggest that moclobemide may have anticonvulsant property.

Citalopram--a review of pharmacological and clinical effects. To provide clinicians with a critical evaluation of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available in Canada since March 1999. Commercial searches (MEDLINE and BiblioTech) and an "in-house" search (InfoDrug) were used to find published English-language references for clinical and preclinical publications. There was no restriction of publication dates. Primary index terms used were: pharmacological properties, receptors, pharmacological selectivity, pharmacokinetics, age-related pharmacokinetics, sex-related pharmacokinetics, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, cytochrome activity, drug interactions, adverse reactions, antidepressant switching, precautions, overdose, drug discontinuation, children, geriatric, depression, combination therapy, placebo control, refractory depression, anxiety disorders and medical disorders. A total of 74 studies were reviewed. Twenty-one of these studies specifically examined the clinical efficacy and tolerability of citalopram in depressive disorders as well as other disorders. In depressive disorders, clinical studies were required to have either placebo or active comparison controls for a minimum of 3 weeks. For other disorders, in the absence of double-blind trials, open-label studies were included. Pharmacological studies were limited to animal studies focusing on citalopram's selectivity and receptor specificity, and positron emission tomography studies were incorporated to include human pharmacological data. Pharmacokinetic studies focused on the metabolism, safety and tolerability of citalopram, specifically with reference to adverse reactions, drug interactions and overdose in addition to citalopram's effect on vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. Data on clinical studies were summarized according to test measures, study duration and outcome of study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were summarized according to properties and interactions. Adverse reactions were extracted to outline citalopram's safety profile. Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant with a more specific and selective pharmacological profile than other antidepressants of its class. It is well tolerated, and drug interactions are not a significant concern. It is also reasonably safe for populations vulnerable to pharmacokinetic effects, such as the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. In addition to its tolerability, citalopram is effective in the treatment of major depression, other depressive disorders and panic disorder. It has the potential to effectively treat other anxiety disorders and substance-use disorders; in addition, it may be useful in several medical conditions. There is evidence to support the role of citalopram as a well-tolerated and effective SSRI antidepressant. There is a need for further evaluation of its role in psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder.

The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders. Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.

Wisdom of the CROUD:  Development and validation of a patient-level prediction model for opioid use disorder using population-level claims data. Some patients who are given opioids for pain could develop opioid use disorder. If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their first opioid. A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424 patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365 days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score, derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15-29, medical history of substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for predicting opioid use disorder. CROUD could be used by clinicians to obtain personalized risk scores. CROUD could be used to further educate those at higher risk and to personalize new opioid dispensing guidelines such as urine testing. Due to the high false positive rate, it should not be used for contraindication or to restrict utilization.

When fever is more than infection: two cases of vancomycin-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, but serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction associated with a range of medications. We present two cases of vancomycin-induced DRESS, which occurred simultaneously in the orthopaedic ward in an outer metropolitan hospital. These cases demonstrate the complexity in the diagnosis and management of this inflammatory syndrome on the background of known infection as well as evidence for linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin. The first case was managed conservatively, but developed progressive renal and liver injury along with demonstrated cytomegalovirus reactivation and recurrent colitis, and was eventually palliated. The second was commenced on intravenous glucocorticoids and achieved remission, although had ongoing renal dysfunction at the time of discharge from outpatient follow-up.

Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in impaired renal function: is it time for a dose adjustment? A case report and review of literature. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), but the incidence of drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) is not well defined. We investigate linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with impaired renal function. Since recent studies suggest that linezolid clearance is reduced in these patients and there are no precise data confirming that dose-adjustment should be required, we performed a systematic analysis in order to establish whether it is necessary to consider a dose adjustment and promote studies to confirm this concept. We report a case of thrombocytopenia (nadir 32 * 10(3)/mul) in a patient with acute kidney injury who was treated with linezolid for a MRSA pulmonary infection. We performed a systematic review of the literature through PubMed with the aim to include every case report, case series, prospective and retrospective clinical study reporting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia with concomitant impaired renal function. An increasing number of clinical studies suggest a correlation between the onset of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of platelet count and hemoglobin is recommended in patients treated with linezolid, especially in those with impaired renal function because the reduction of its clearance causes drug accumulation, as some studies have reported. Clinicians should consider the potential risk of this complication, especially in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease. Further studies should be encouraged to determine if the incidence of linezolid-related thrombocytopenia could be reduced by a dose adjustment according to renal function, for which currently there is still no specific recommendation.

Linezolid. Multiple antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in hospitals. Problem organisms include multiply resistant strains of pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci; for many of these the glycopeptide vancomycin has become the treatment of last resort. This situation has been made worse by the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. Fortunately, several compounds active against resistant Gram-positive bacteria are in active development. One of these is linezolid, the first of the oxazolidinones, a new class of antibacterial. Linezolid is a synthetic agent which is active against all the clinically important Gram-positive bacteria, including multiply resistant strains. It has good pharmacokinetics, with equal bioavailability by both oral and intravenous routes and no need for dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. The drug has a good safety profile and clinical trials have given excellent results in a variety of skin and soft tissue, respiratory and bloodstream infections. Linezolid is a promising drug, which, together with prudent antibiotic use and the prevention and control of hospital infection, will help in the battle against multiply antibiotic resistant Gram-positive bacteria.

Impact of administration of vancomycin or linezolid to critically ill patients with impaired renal function. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vancomycin (VAN) versus linezolid (LZD) on renal function in patients with renal failure (RF) admitted to intensive care units. This was a multicenter, retrospective, comparative cohort study. Renal failure patients were treated with VAN or LZD for proven or suspected infections by multiresistant Gram-positive cocci. Changes in plasma creatinine levels and creatinine clearance at the start and end of treatment were used as endpoints. A total of 147 patients were treated with VAN (group A, n = 68) or LZD (group B, n = 79). Group B included more patients with diabetes mellitus [9 (13.2%) vs. 25 (31.6%); p = 0.007], septic shock [39 (57.4%) vs. 60 (75.9%); p = 0.013] and greater RF (mean ClCr 42.24 ml/min vs. 37.57 ml/min; p = 0.04). Renal function improved in patients from both groups who did not require renal replacement therapy. A greater improvement was seen in group B [percent decrease in Cr (27.94 vs. 9.48; p = 0.02) and percent increase in ClCr (95.96 vs. 55.06; p = 0.05)]. In group A, nine patients (13.2%) experienced an antibiotic-related increase in RF, and antibiotic was discontinued in five patients due to adverse effects. It is reasonable to avoid use of VAN in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.

Gitelman-like syndrome: A rare complication of using aminoglycosides in tuberculosis - A case report. Aminoglycosides are known to cause electrolyte disturbances. Approximately 8-26% of patients who receive an aminoglycoside for several days develop mild renal impairment that is almost always reversible (Brunton et al., 2013). A 46 year old male with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis with resistance to kanamycin is being presented, who was on injectable Capreomycin, Levofloxacin, Ethionamide, Cycloserine, pyrazinamide, linezolid and clofazamine for a period of four months. He presented to us with generalised weakness and pain in the lower limb muscles. Investigation revealed hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalceuria and hypocalcemia. This features mimic Gitelman's syndrome which is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting kidneys causing electrolyte disturbances. The drug was immediately withdrawn and electrolyte correction was given and the condition reversed gradually.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through several intermediate entities or processes. Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and ADHD**: Dextroamphetamine is used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patients with ADHD often have comorbidities such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance abuse.
2. **Anxiety disorders and linezolid**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including those that can cause anxiety disorders or exacerbate existing anxiety conditions. In some cases, linezolid may be prescribed to patients with anxiety disorders who have developed infections.
3. **Vancomycin and linezolid**: Vancomycin is another antibiotic that can be used to treat similar infections. However, vancomycin has been associated with a higher risk of nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Linezolid is sometimes used as an alternative to vancomycin in these cases.
4. **Dextroamphetamine and vancomycin**: Although there is no direct interaction between dextroamphetamine and vancomycin, patients with ADHD who are taking dextroamphetamine may be more likely to experience anxiety or other comorbidities that require treatment with antibiotics like vancomycin.
5. **Linezolid and thrombocytopenia**: Linezolid has been associated with thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. This condition can increase the risk of bleeding and may require careful monitoring and dose adjustment.
6. **Dextroamphetamine and platelet count**: Some studies suggest that psychostimulants like dextroamphetamine may affect platelet count or increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, although this is not a well-established relationship.

The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid can be summarized as follows:

* Dextroamphetamine is used to treat ADHD, which often co-occurs with anxiety disorders or other conditions that may require antibiotic treatment.
* Linezolid is an antibiotic that may be prescribed to patients with anxiety disorders or other conditions that are comorbid with ADHD.
* Vancomycin, an alternative antibiotic, has a higher risk of nephrotoxicity, which may lead to the use of linezolid as a substitute.
* Linezolid has been associated with thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.
* Dextroamphetamine may potentially affect platelet count or increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, although this relationship is not well established.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid is based on the comorbidities associated with ADHD, the use of antibiotics like vancomycin and linezolid, and the potential risks of thrombocytopenia associated with linezolid. This narrative highlights the complex interactions between different medications, medical conditions, and patient populations.

A randomized double-blind trial of paroxetine and/or dextroamphetamine and problem-focused therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults. To determine the effect of psychotherapy, dextroamphetamine, and/or paroxetine on attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) in adults. Ninety-eight adults with DSM-IV ADHD were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy and dextroamphetamine, paroxetine, both, or placebo for 20 weeks. A 2 x 2 factorial design compared patients who received dextroamphetamine versus no dextroamphetamine with patients who received paroxetine versus no paroxetine. Data were collected from August 2000 until May 2002. One half of the 98 enrolled subjects were found to have at least 1 lifetime mood or anxiety disorder on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Sixty percent of patients who received medication and 80% of those who received placebo completed the 5-month trial. ADHD symptoms were significantly (p = .012) lower in patients in the completer group who received dextroamphetamine. Paroxetine had no effect on ADHD. Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Depression (HAM-D) scores were low to start, and no treatment differences were evident at endpoint. Significantly (p < .001) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as ADHD responders if they received dextroamphetamine (85.7%) or combined treatment (66.7%) versus paroxetine (20.0%) or placebo (21.1%). Significantly (p = .003) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as mood/anxiety responders if they received paroxetine (100%) or combined treatment (73.3%) versus those receiving dextroamphetamine (57.15%) or placebo (47.4%). Clinicians rated any patient who received medication and psychological therapy as significantly more improved overall than those who received placebo and psychological therapy (intent to treat: p = .033; completers: p = .001). ADHD symptoms improved with dextroamphetamine. Mood and internalizing symptoms were seen as improved with paroxetine by clinicians, despite absence of response on the HAM-A and HAM-D. The presence of a lifetime internalizing disorder attenuated the response to dextroamphetamine. Patients who received both dextroamphetamine and paroxetine had more severe adverse events but did not show greater improvement overall than patients treated with 1 medication.

Rivastigmine-induced dystonia. A case of acute dystonia related to rivastigmine use is reported. A 61-year-old Caucasian woman who had suffered from bipolar II disorder with rapid cycling for over 30 years was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit. In addition to bipolar II disorder, the patient had been previously diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various anxiety disorders. During the current hospitalization, she was taking clonazepam, dextroamphetamine, lamotrigine, lansoprazole, levothyroxine, memantine, quetiapine, risperidone, rivastigmine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, and zolpidem. Soon after hospital admission, she began to complain of a tightening in her chest. A review of her records revealed similar complaints during previous hospitalizations. Rivastigmine was discontinued due to concerns of interactions with her antipsychotic regimen. Although these symptoms were previously attributed to anxiety, they appeared worse during this hospitalization. During these events she would be witnessed lying in bed in a supine position with her head canted posteriorly. Benztropine was given to help determine if she was having a dystonic reaction. Within 30 minutes, her chest discomfort began to resolve, and her symptoms resolved completely over the next 48 hours. Three days later, rivastigmine was restarted by the attending psychiatrist because of concerns about the patient's memory, and the dystonia-like symptoms returned within 2 hours of her morning dose. Rivastigmine was discontinued, and benztropine was given and then discontinued, with no return of symptoms for the remainder of her two-week hospitalization. A patient with bipolar II disorder and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease developed dystonia, possibly caused by rivastigmine. However, the patient was taking various other medications that could have lowered the threshold for extrapyramidal syndromes.

Pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents: focus on guidelines for the primary care practitioner. This article is a practical review of the current psychopharmacological agents used in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and pemoline are effective in the control of symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The controlled release preparations and the adjunctive use of clonidine are helpful to extend stimulant effects and control adverse effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in individual cases of child and adolescent depression, but adverse effects may limit their use. Clomipramine has been found to be effective for childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder. Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be safer for depression and are also useful in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Buspirone is effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children. Newer atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone may have less limiting adverse effects than older antipsychotics in the treatment of psychosis and severe behaviour disorders, but the physician must be vigilant for the emergence of tardive dyskinesia. Drug treatment in children and adolescents must take into account the child's environmental influences and be part of an overall treatment plan where individual, familial and cultural issues are addressed.

Clinical assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that frequently persists into adulthood, with significant levels of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behavior. Impairments associated with adult ADHD include distress from the symptoms, impaired ability to function in work and academic settings, and problems sustaining stable relationships. The disorder is commonly associated with volatile moods, antisocial behavior, and drug and alcohol misuse. There is an increased risk of developing comorbid anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and drug and alcohol dependence. Despite the proven effectiveness of drugs such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and atomoxetine, few cases of ADHD are recognized and treated in the UK. The reasons for this are unclear, since most psychiatrists working with children and adolescents are aware that ADHD commonly persists into adult life and they also see the disorder affecting parents of children with ADHD. Issues of transition from the care of child to adult psychiatry and the need to refer adult relatives of children with ADHD to suitable psychiatric services are a major concern. Furthermore, many cases of adult ADHD go unrecognized or are seen by mental health teams that are not familiar with the subtleties of the adult presentation. As a result, misdiagnosis and treatment for conditions such as atypical depression, mixed affective disorder, cyclothymia, and borderline and unstable emotional personality disorders is not uncommon. There is therefore a requirement for further training in this area. This review will describe the common clinical presentation and provide guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Any psychiatrically trained physician using standard psychiatric assessment procedures can perform clinical evaluations for adult ADHD. As with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood, ADHD has its own characteristic onset, course and psychopathology. Symptoms of ADHD are trait-like, being stable characteristics from early childhood, and commonly co-occur with affective instability. Stimulants are the mainstay of treatment and are effective in around 70% of cases. Psychotherapeutic interventions also have an important role. These guidelines will assist psychiatrists and other adult mental health workers in identifying and treating individuals with adult ADHD.

Free-operant avoidance behavior by rats after reinforcer revaluation using opioid agonists and D-amphetamine. The associative processes that support free-operant instrumental avoidance behavior are still unknown. We used a revaluation procedure to determine whether the performance of an avoidance response is sensitive to the current value of the aversive, negative reinforcer. Rats were trained on an unsignaled, free-operant lever press avoidance paradigm in which each response avoided or escaped shock and produced a 5 s feedback stimulus. The revaluation procedure consisted of noncontingent presentations of the shock in the absence of the lever either paired or unpaired with systemic morphine and in a different cohort with systemic d-amphetamine. Rats were then tested drug free during an extinction test. In both the d-amphetamine and morphine groups, pairing of the drug and shock decreased subsequent avoidance responding during the extinction test, suggesting that avoidance behavior was sensitive to the current incentive value of the aversive negative reinforcer. Experiment 2 used central infusions of D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the periacqueductal gray and nucleus accumbens shell to revalue the shock. Infusions of DAMGO in both regions replicated the effects seen with systemic morphine. These results are the first to demonstrate the impact of revaluation of an aversive reinforcer on avoidance behavior using pharmacological agents, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of avoidance behavior symptomatic of anxiety disorders.

Matching the bipolar patient and the mood stabilizer. Bipolar disorder poses many treatment challenges, including "matching" a particular patient with the optimal treatment regimen. Although there are a number of extant guidelines to assist the clinician in selecting treatment, these recommendations are largely based on general variables and fail to take into account the subtleties and complications that confront a clinician in practice. An analysis of predictors of medication response in bipolar disorder provides a basis for matching patients with optimal medication regimens. Response to treatment may depend on the polarity of an episode or on clinical features such as mixed or psychotic symptomatology and rate of cycling. Comorbid psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder should also be considered in designing a treatment regimen. Similarly, medical conditions, especially metabolic abnormalities or kidney insufficiency, must be taken into account. Selection of medication may also involve an analysis of demographic factors, including family and personal history of response to a particular agent. When selecting the most appropriate mood stabilizer for a patient--particularly when polypharmacy is required--the clinician should keep potential side effects and drug interactions in mind. Randomized, controlled studies in bipolar populations are needed to further characterize optimal matching of patient and medication.

Moclobemide: therapeutic use and clinical studies. Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine-oxidase-A (RIMA) and has been extensively evaluated in the treatment of a wide spectrum of depressive disorders and less extensively studied in anxiety disorders. Nearly all meta-analyses and most comparative studies indicated that in the acute management of depression this drug is more efficacious than placebo and as efficacious as tricyclic (or some heterocyclic) antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is a growing evidence that moclobemide is not inferior to other antidepressants in the treatment of subtypes of depression, such as dysthymia, endogenous (unipolar and bipolar), reactive, atypical, agitated, and retarded depression as with other antidepressants limited evidence suggests that moclobemide has consistent long-term efficacy. However, more controlled studies addressing this issue are needed. For patients with bipolar depression the risk of developing mania seems to be not higher with moclobemide than with other antidepressants. The effective therapeutic dose range for moclobemide in most acute phase trials was 300 to 600 mg, divided in 2 to 3 doses. While one controlled trial and one long-term open-label study found moclobemide to be efficacious in social phobia, three controlled trials subsequently revealed either no effect or less robust effects with the tendency of higher doses (600 - 900 mg/d) to be more efficacious. Two comparative trials demonstrated moclobemide to be as efficacious as fluoxetine or clomipramine in patients suffering from panic disorder. Placebo-controlled trials in this indication are, however, still lacking. A relationship between the plasma concentration of moclobemide and its therapeutic efficacy is not apparent but a positive correlation with adverse events has been found. Dizziness, nausea and insomnia occurred more frequently on moclobemide than on placebo. Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants. Gastrointestinal side effects and, especially, sexual dysfunction were much less frequent with moclobemide than with SSRIs. Unlike irreversible MAO-inhibitors, moclobemide has a negligible propensity to induce hypertensive crisis after ingestion of tyramine-rich food ("cheese-reaction"). Therefore, dietary restrictions are not as strict. However, with moclobemide doses above 900 mg/d the risk of interaction with ingested tyramine might become clinically relevant. After multiple dosing the oral bioavailability of moclobemide reaches almost 100%. At therapeutic doses, moclobemide lacks significant negative effects on psychomotor performance, cognitive function or cardiovascular system. Due to the relative freedom from these side effects, moclobemide is particularly attractive in the treatment of elderly patients. Moclobemide is a substrate of CYP2C19. Although it acts as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, relatively few clinically important drug interactions involving moclobemide have been reported. It is relatively safe even in overdose. The drug has a short plasma elimination half-life that allows switching to an alternative agent within 24 h. Since it is well tolerated, therapeutic doses can often be reached rapidly upon onset of treatment. Steady-state plasma levels are reached approximately at one week following dose adjustment. Patients with renal dysfunction require no dose reduction in contrast to patients with severe hepatic impairment. Cases of refractory depression might improve with a combination of moclobemide with other antidepressants, such as clomipramine or a SSRI. Since this combination has rarely been associated with a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome, it requires lower entry doses, a slower dose titration and a more careful monitoring of patients. Combination therapy with moclobemide and other serotonergic agents, or opioids, should be undertaken with caution, although no serious adverse events have been published with therapeutic doses of moclobemide to date. On the basis of animal data the combined use of moclobemide with pethidine or dextropropoxyphene should be avoided. There is no evidence that moclobemide would increase body weight or produce seizures. Some preclinical data suggest that moclobemide may have anticonvulsant property.

Citalopram--a review of pharmacological and clinical effects. To provide clinicians with a critical evaluation of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available in Canada since March 1999. Commercial searches (MEDLINE and BiblioTech) and an "in-house" search (InfoDrug) were used to find published English-language references for clinical and preclinical publications. There was no restriction of publication dates. Primary index terms used were: pharmacological properties, receptors, pharmacological selectivity, pharmacokinetics, age-related pharmacokinetics, sex-related pharmacokinetics, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, cytochrome activity, drug interactions, adverse reactions, antidepressant switching, precautions, overdose, drug discontinuation, children, geriatric, depression, combination therapy, placebo control, refractory depression, anxiety disorders and medical disorders. A total of 74 studies were reviewed. Twenty-one of these studies specifically examined the clinical efficacy and tolerability of citalopram in depressive disorders as well as other disorders. In depressive disorders, clinical studies were required to have either placebo or active comparison controls for a minimum of 3 weeks. For other disorders, in the absence of double-blind trials, open-label studies were included. Pharmacological studies were limited to animal studies focusing on citalopram's selectivity and receptor specificity, and positron emission tomography studies were incorporated to include human pharmacological data. Pharmacokinetic studies focused on the metabolism, safety and tolerability of citalopram, specifically with reference to adverse reactions, drug interactions and overdose in addition to citalopram's effect on vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. Data on clinical studies were summarized according to test measures, study duration and outcome of study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were summarized according to properties and interactions. Adverse reactions were extracted to outline citalopram's safety profile. Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant with a more specific and selective pharmacological profile than other antidepressants of its class. It is well tolerated, and drug interactions are not a significant concern. It is also reasonably safe for populations vulnerable to pharmacokinetic effects, such as the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. In addition to its tolerability, citalopram is effective in the treatment of major depression, other depressive disorders and panic disorder. It has the potential to effectively treat other anxiety disorders and substance-use disorders; in addition, it may be useful in several medical conditions. There is evidence to support the role of citalopram as a well-tolerated and effective SSRI antidepressant. There is a need for further evaluation of its role in psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder.

The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders. Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.

Wisdom of the CROUD:  Development and validation of a patient-level prediction model for opioid use disorder using population-level claims data. Some patients who are given opioids for pain could develop opioid use disorder. If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their first opioid. A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424 patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365 days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score, derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15-29, medical history of substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for predicting opioid use disorder. CROUD could be used by clinicians to obtain personalized risk scores. CROUD could be used to further educate those at higher risk and to personalize new opioid dispensing guidelines such as urine testing. Due to the high false positive rate, it should not be used for contraindication or to restrict utilization.

When fever is more than infection: two cases of vancomycin-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, but serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction associated with a range of medications. We present two cases of vancomycin-induced DRESS, which occurred simultaneously in the orthopaedic ward in an outer metropolitan hospital. These cases demonstrate the complexity in the diagnosis and management of this inflammatory syndrome on the background of known infection as well as evidence for linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin. The first case was managed conservatively, but developed progressive renal and liver injury along with demonstrated cytomegalovirus reactivation and recurrent colitis, and was eventually palliated. The second was commenced on intravenous glucocorticoids and achieved remission, although had ongoing renal dysfunction at the time of discharge from outpatient follow-up.

Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in impaired renal function: is it time for a dose adjustment? A case report and review of literature. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), but the incidence of drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) is not well defined. We investigate linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with impaired renal function. Since recent studies suggest that linezolid clearance is reduced in these patients and there are no precise data confirming that dose-adjustment should be required, we performed a systematic analysis in order to establish whether it is necessary to consider a dose adjustment and promote studies to confirm this concept. We report a case of thrombocytopenia (nadir 32 * 10(3)/mul) in a patient with acute kidney injury who was treated with linezolid for a MRSA pulmonary infection. We performed a systematic review of the literature through PubMed with the aim to include every case report, case series, prospective and retrospective clinical study reporting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia with concomitant impaired renal function. An increasing number of clinical studies suggest a correlation between the onset of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of platelet count and hemoglobin is recommended in patients treated with linezolid, especially in those with impaired renal function because the reduction of its clearance causes drug accumulation, as some studies have reported. Clinicians should consider the potential risk of this complication, especially in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease. Further studies should be encouraged to determine if the incidence of linezolid-related thrombocytopenia could be reduced by a dose adjustment according to renal function, for which currently there is still no specific recommendation.

Impact of administration of vancomycin or linezolid to critically ill patients with impaired renal function. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vancomycin (VAN) versus linezolid (LZD) on renal function in patients with renal failure (RF) admitted to intensive care units. This was a multicenter, retrospective, comparative cohort study. Renal failure patients were treated with VAN or LZD for proven or suspected infections by multiresistant Gram-positive cocci. Changes in plasma creatinine levels and creatinine clearance at the start and end of treatment were used as endpoints. A total of 147 patients were treated with VAN (group A, n = 68) or LZD (group B, n = 79). Group B included more patients with diabetes mellitus [9 (13.2%) vs. 25 (31.6%); p = 0.007], septic shock [39 (57.4%) vs. 60 (75.9%); p = 0.013] and greater RF (mean ClCr 42.24 ml/min vs. 37.57 ml/min; p = 0.04). Renal function improved in patients from both groups who did not require renal replacement therapy. A greater improvement was seen in group B [percent decrease in Cr (27.94 vs. 9.48; p = 0.02) and percent increase in ClCr (95.96 vs. 55.06; p = 0.05)]. In group A, nine patients (13.2%) experienced an antibiotic-related increase in RF, and antibiotic was discontinued in five patients due to adverse effects. It is reasonable to avoid use of VAN in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.

Gitelman-like syndrome: A rare complication of using aminoglycosides in tuberculosis - A case report. Aminoglycosides are known to cause electrolyte disturbances. Approximately 8-26% of patients who receive an aminoglycoside for several days develop mild renal impairment that is almost always reversible (Brunton et al., 2013). A 46 year old male with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis with resistance to kanamycin is being presented, who was on injectable Capreomycin, Levofloxacin, Ethionamide, Cycloserine, pyrazinamide, linezolid and clofazamine for a period of four months. He presented to us with generalised weakness and pain in the lower limb muscles. Investigation revealed hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalceuria and hypocalcemia. This features mimic Gitelman's syndrome which is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting kidneys causing electrolyte disturbances. The drug was immediately withdrawn and electrolyte correction was given and the condition reversed gradually.

High plasma linezolid concentration and impaired renal function affect development of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is sometimes observed during linezolid therapy. Here, we aimed to investigate the factors affecting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. A prospective observational study was performed between October 2009 and February 2011; 30 patients were included. Plasma linezolid trough concentrations were measured on days 3, 7 and 14 after initial drug administration. Platelet counts and haemoglobin levels were also monitored. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17 patients (56.7%). Median linezolid trough concentrations on day 3 were significantly higher in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) than in patients without renal impairment (14.7 versus 4.8 mg/L; P < 0.0001). Median linezolid trough concentrations on day 3 in patients who developed thrombocytopenia were also significantly higher than those in patients who did not (13.4 versus 4.3 mg/L, P < 0.0001). Development of thrombocytopenia occurred significantly more frequently in patients with linezolid trough concentration >7.5 mg/L (OR, 90.0; P < 0.0001) and renal impairment (OR, 39.0; P = 0.0002). The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the median time from the initiation of therapy to development of thrombocytopenia was 11 days. Patients with renal impairment are more likely to have a high plasma linezolid concentration. In addition, a high plasma linezolid concentration and renal impairment significantly affected the development of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Further studies are required to evaluate whether therapeutic drug monitoring-guided dosage adjustment of linezolid decreases the adverse effects while maintaining treatment efficacy in patients with renal dysfunction.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid might exist through several intermediate entities or processes. Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Dextroamphetamine and ADHD**: Dextroamphetamine is commonly used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patients with ADHD often have comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance abuse.
2. **Comorbidities and antibiotic use**: Individuals with ADHD and comorbidities may be more likely to require antibiotic treatment for various infections. Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat severe infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
3. **Linezolid and renal function**: Linezolid can cause thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Renal function is crucial in eliminating linezolid, and impaired renal function can lead to increased plasma concentrations of the drug.
4. **Dextroamphetamine and renal function**: Although not directly related, dextroamphetamine may indirectly affect renal function in patients with ADHD and comorbidities. For example, patients with ADHD and substance abuse may be more likely to experience renal impairment due to drug use or other factors.
5. **Intermediate entities: psychiatric disorders and substance abuse**: Psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders, can increase the risk of substance abuse, which may lead to renal impairment. Dextroamphetamine, used to treat ADHD, may be prescribed to patients with these comorbidities, potentially increasing the risk of substance abuse and subsequent renal impairment.
6. **Linezolid and dextroamphetamine interaction**: Although there is no direct interaction between linezolid and dextroamphetamine, the indirect relationship lies in the potential for patients with ADHD and comorbidities to require linezolid treatment and experience renal impairment, which can increase the risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.

In summary, the indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid may exist through the following pathway:

ADHD (treated with dextroamphetamine) → Comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, mood disorders, substance abuse) → Increased risk of antibiotic use (e.g., linezolid) → Renal impairment (due to various factors, including substance abuse) → Increased risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia

This narrative highlights the complex interplay between psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and antibiotic use, which can lead to an increased risk of adverse events, such as linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, in patients with ADHD and comorbidities.

A randomized double-blind trial of paroxetine and/or dextroamphetamine and problem-focused therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults. To determine the effect of psychotherapy, dextroamphetamine, and/or paroxetine on attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) in adults. Ninety-eight adults with DSM-IV ADHD were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy and dextroamphetamine, paroxetine, both, or placebo for 20 weeks. A 2 x 2 factorial design compared patients who received dextroamphetamine versus no dextroamphetamine with patients who received paroxetine versus no paroxetine. Data were collected from August 2000 until May 2002. One half of the 98 enrolled subjects were found to have at least 1 lifetime mood or anxiety disorder on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Sixty percent of patients who received medication and 80% of those who received placebo completed the 5-month trial. ADHD symptoms were significantly (p = .012) lower in patients in the completer group who received dextroamphetamine. Paroxetine had no effect on ADHD. Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Depression (HAM-D) scores were low to start, and no treatment differences were evident at endpoint. Significantly (p < .001) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as ADHD responders if they received dextroamphetamine (85.7%) or combined treatment (66.7%) versus paroxetine (20.0%) or placebo (21.1%). Significantly (p = .003) more patients in the completer group were rated by clinicians as mood/anxiety responders if they received paroxetine (100%) or combined treatment (73.3%) versus those receiving dextroamphetamine (57.15%) or placebo (47.4%). Clinicians rated any patient who received medication and psychological therapy as significantly more improved overall than those who received placebo and psychological therapy (intent to treat: p = .033; completers: p = .001). ADHD symptoms improved with dextroamphetamine. Mood and internalizing symptoms were seen as improved with paroxetine by clinicians, despite absence of response on the HAM-A and HAM-D. The presence of a lifetime internalizing disorder attenuated the response to dextroamphetamine. Patients who received both dextroamphetamine and paroxetine had more severe adverse events but did not show greater improvement overall than patients treated with 1 medication.

Pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents: focus on guidelines for the primary care practitioner. This article is a practical review of the current psychopharmacological agents used in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and pemoline are effective in the control of symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The controlled release preparations and the adjunctive use of clonidine are helpful to extend stimulant effects and control adverse effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in individual cases of child and adolescent depression, but adverse effects may limit their use. Clomipramine has been found to be effective for childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder. Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be safer for depression and are also useful in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Buspirone is effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children. Newer atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone may have less limiting adverse effects than older antipsychotics in the treatment of psychosis and severe behaviour disorders, but the physician must be vigilant for the emergence of tardive dyskinesia. Drug treatment in children and adolescents must take into account the child's environmental influences and be part of an overall treatment plan where individual, familial and cultural issues are addressed.

Clinical assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that frequently persists into adulthood, with significant levels of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behavior. Impairments associated with adult ADHD include distress from the symptoms, impaired ability to function in work and academic settings, and problems sustaining stable relationships. The disorder is commonly associated with volatile moods, antisocial behavior, and drug and alcohol misuse. There is an increased risk of developing comorbid anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and drug and alcohol dependence. Despite the proven effectiveness of drugs such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and atomoxetine, few cases of ADHD are recognized and treated in the UK. The reasons for this are unclear, since most psychiatrists working with children and adolescents are aware that ADHD commonly persists into adult life and they also see the disorder affecting parents of children with ADHD. Issues of transition from the care of child to adult psychiatry and the need to refer adult relatives of children with ADHD to suitable psychiatric services are a major concern. Furthermore, many cases of adult ADHD go unrecognized or are seen by mental health teams that are not familiar with the subtleties of the adult presentation. As a result, misdiagnosis and treatment for conditions such as atypical depression, mixed affective disorder, cyclothymia, and borderline and unstable emotional personality disorders is not uncommon. There is therefore a requirement for further training in this area. This review will describe the common clinical presentation and provide guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Any psychiatrically trained physician using standard psychiatric assessment procedures can perform clinical evaluations for adult ADHD. As with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood, ADHD has its own characteristic onset, course and psychopathology. Symptoms of ADHD are trait-like, being stable characteristics from early childhood, and commonly co-occur with affective instability. Stimulants are the mainstay of treatment and are effective in around 70% of cases. Psychotherapeutic interventions also have an important role. These guidelines will assist psychiatrists and other adult mental health workers in identifying and treating individuals with adult ADHD.

Free-operant avoidance behavior by rats after reinforcer revaluation using opioid agonists and D-amphetamine. The associative processes that support free-operant instrumental avoidance behavior are still unknown. We used a revaluation procedure to determine whether the performance of an avoidance response is sensitive to the current value of the aversive, negative reinforcer. Rats were trained on an unsignaled, free-operant lever press avoidance paradigm in which each response avoided or escaped shock and produced a 5 s feedback stimulus. The revaluation procedure consisted of noncontingent presentations of the shock in the absence of the lever either paired or unpaired with systemic morphine and in a different cohort with systemic d-amphetamine. Rats were then tested drug free during an extinction test. In both the d-amphetamine and morphine groups, pairing of the drug and shock decreased subsequent avoidance responding during the extinction test, suggesting that avoidance behavior was sensitive to the current incentive value of the aversive negative reinforcer. Experiment 2 used central infusions of D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the periacqueductal gray and nucleus accumbens shell to revalue the shock. Infusions of DAMGO in both regions replicated the effects seen with systemic morphine. These results are the first to demonstrate the impact of revaluation of an aversive reinforcer on avoidance behavior using pharmacological agents, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of avoidance behavior symptomatic of anxiety disorders.

Psychomimic syndrome.

Matching the bipolar patient and the mood stabilizer. Bipolar disorder poses many treatment challenges, including "matching" a particular patient with the optimal treatment regimen. Although there are a number of extant guidelines to assist the clinician in selecting treatment, these recommendations are largely based on general variables and fail to take into account the subtleties and complications that confront a clinician in practice. An analysis of predictors of medication response in bipolar disorder provides a basis for matching patients with optimal medication regimens. Response to treatment may depend on the polarity of an episode or on clinical features such as mixed or psychotic symptomatology and rate of cycling. Comorbid psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder should also be considered in designing a treatment regimen. Similarly, medical conditions, especially metabolic abnormalities or kidney insufficiency, must be taken into account. Selection of medication may also involve an analysis of demographic factors, including family and personal history of response to a particular agent. When selecting the most appropriate mood stabilizer for a patient--particularly when polypharmacy is required--the clinician should keep potential side effects and drug interactions in mind. Randomized, controlled studies in bipolar populations are needed to further characterize optimal matching of patient and medication.

Moclobemide: therapeutic use and clinical studies. Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine-oxidase-A (RIMA) and has been extensively evaluated in the treatment of a wide spectrum of depressive disorders and less extensively studied in anxiety disorders. Nearly all meta-analyses and most comparative studies indicated that in the acute management of depression this drug is more efficacious than placebo and as efficacious as tricyclic (or some heterocyclic) antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is a growing evidence that moclobemide is not inferior to other antidepressants in the treatment of subtypes of depression, such as dysthymia, endogenous (unipolar and bipolar), reactive, atypical, agitated, and retarded depression as with other antidepressants limited evidence suggests that moclobemide has consistent long-term efficacy. However, more controlled studies addressing this issue are needed. For patients with bipolar depression the risk of developing mania seems to be not higher with moclobemide than with other antidepressants. The effective therapeutic dose range for moclobemide in most acute phase trials was 300 to 600 mg, divided in 2 to 3 doses. While one controlled trial and one long-term open-label study found moclobemide to be efficacious in social phobia, three controlled trials subsequently revealed either no effect or less robust effects with the tendency of higher doses (600 - 900 mg/d) to be more efficacious. Two comparative trials demonstrated moclobemide to be as efficacious as fluoxetine or clomipramine in patients suffering from panic disorder. Placebo-controlled trials in this indication are, however, still lacking. A relationship between the plasma concentration of moclobemide and its therapeutic efficacy is not apparent but a positive correlation with adverse events has been found. Dizziness, nausea and insomnia occurred more frequently on moclobemide than on placebo. Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants. Gastrointestinal side effects and, especially, sexual dysfunction were much less frequent with moclobemide than with SSRIs. Unlike irreversible MAO-inhibitors, moclobemide has a negligible propensity to induce hypertensive crisis after ingestion of tyramine-rich food ("cheese-reaction"). Therefore, dietary restrictions are not as strict. However, with moclobemide doses above 900 mg/d the risk of interaction with ingested tyramine might become clinically relevant. After multiple dosing the oral bioavailability of moclobemide reaches almost 100%. At therapeutic doses, moclobemide lacks significant negative effects on psychomotor performance, cognitive function or cardiovascular system. Due to the relative freedom from these side effects, moclobemide is particularly attractive in the treatment of elderly patients. Moclobemide is a substrate of CYP2C19. Although it acts as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, relatively few clinically important drug interactions involving moclobemide have been reported. It is relatively safe even in overdose. The drug has a short plasma elimination half-life that allows switching to an alternative agent within 24 h. Since it is well tolerated, therapeutic doses can often be reached rapidly upon onset of treatment. Steady-state plasma levels are reached approximately at one week following dose adjustment. Patients with renal dysfunction require no dose reduction in contrast to patients with severe hepatic impairment. Cases of refractory depression might improve with a combination of moclobemide with other antidepressants, such as clomipramine or a SSRI. Since this combination has rarely been associated with a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome, it requires lower entry doses, a slower dose titration and a more careful monitoring of patients. Combination therapy with moclobemide and other serotonergic agents, or opioids, should be undertaken with caution, although no serious adverse events have been published with therapeutic doses of moclobemide to date. On the basis of animal data the combined use of moclobemide with pethidine or dextropropoxyphene should be avoided. There is no evidence that moclobemide would increase body weight or produce seizures. Some preclinical data suggest that moclobemide may have anticonvulsant property.

Citalopram--a review of pharmacological and clinical effects. To provide clinicians with a critical evaluation of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available in Canada since March 1999. Commercial searches (MEDLINE and BiblioTech) and an "in-house" search (InfoDrug) were used to find published English-language references for clinical and preclinical publications. There was no restriction of publication dates. Primary index terms used were: pharmacological properties, receptors, pharmacological selectivity, pharmacokinetics, age-related pharmacokinetics, sex-related pharmacokinetics, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, cytochrome activity, drug interactions, adverse reactions, antidepressant switching, precautions, overdose, drug discontinuation, children, geriatric, depression, combination therapy, placebo control, refractory depression, anxiety disorders and medical disorders. A total of 74 studies were reviewed. Twenty-one of these studies specifically examined the clinical efficacy and tolerability of citalopram in depressive disorders as well as other disorders. In depressive disorders, clinical studies were required to have either placebo or active comparison controls for a minimum of 3 weeks. For other disorders, in the absence of double-blind trials, open-label studies were included. Pharmacological studies were limited to animal studies focusing on citalopram's selectivity and receptor specificity, and positron emission tomography studies were incorporated to include human pharmacological data. Pharmacokinetic studies focused on the metabolism, safety and tolerability of citalopram, specifically with reference to adverse reactions, drug interactions and overdose in addition to citalopram's effect on vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. Data on clinical studies were summarized according to test measures, study duration and outcome of study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were summarized according to properties and interactions. Adverse reactions were extracted to outline citalopram's safety profile. Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant with a more specific and selective pharmacological profile than other antidepressants of its class. It is well tolerated, and drug interactions are not a significant concern. It is also reasonably safe for populations vulnerable to pharmacokinetic effects, such as the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. In addition to its tolerability, citalopram is effective in the treatment of major depression, other depressive disorders and panic disorder. It has the potential to effectively treat other anxiety disorders and substance-use disorders; in addition, it may be useful in several medical conditions. There is evidence to support the role of citalopram as a well-tolerated and effective SSRI antidepressant. There is a need for further evaluation of its role in psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder.

The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders. Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.

Wisdom of the CROUD:  Development and validation of a patient-level prediction model for opioid use disorder using population-level claims data. Some patients who are given opioids for pain could develop opioid use disorder. If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their first opioid. A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424 patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365 days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score, derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15-29, medical history of substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for predicting opioid use disorder. CROUD could be used by clinicians to obtain personalized risk scores. CROUD could be used to further educate those at higher risk and to personalize new opioid dispensing guidelines such as urine testing. Due to the high false positive rate, it should not be used for contraindication or to restrict utilization.

When fever is more than infection: two cases of vancomycin-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, but serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction associated with a range of medications. We present two cases of vancomycin-induced DRESS, which occurred simultaneously in the orthopaedic ward in an outer metropolitan hospital. These cases demonstrate the complexity in the diagnosis and management of this inflammatory syndrome on the background of known infection as well as evidence for linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin. The first case was managed conservatively, but developed progressive renal and liver injury along with demonstrated cytomegalovirus reactivation and recurrent colitis, and was eventually palliated. The second was commenced on intravenous glucocorticoids and achieved remission, although had ongoing renal dysfunction at the time of discharge from outpatient follow-up.

Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in impaired renal function: is it time for a dose adjustment? A case report and review of literature. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), but the incidence of drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) is not well defined. We investigate linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with impaired renal function. Since recent studies suggest that linezolid clearance is reduced in these patients and there are no precise data confirming that dose-adjustment should be required, we performed a systematic analysis in order to establish whether it is necessary to consider a dose adjustment and promote studies to confirm this concept. We report a case of thrombocytopenia (nadir 32 * 10(3)/mul) in a patient with acute kidney injury who was treated with linezolid for a MRSA pulmonary infection. We performed a systematic review of the literature through PubMed with the aim to include every case report, case series, prospective and retrospective clinical study reporting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia with concomitant impaired renal function. An increasing number of clinical studies suggest a correlation between the onset of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of platelet count and hemoglobin is recommended in patients treated with linezolid, especially in those with impaired renal function because the reduction of its clearance causes drug accumulation, as some studies have reported. Clinicians should consider the potential risk of this complication, especially in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease. Further studies should be encouraged to determine if the incidence of linezolid-related thrombocytopenia could be reduced by a dose adjustment according to renal function, for which currently there is still no specific recommendation.

Impact of administration of vancomycin or linezolid to critically ill patients with impaired renal function. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vancomycin (VAN) versus linezolid (LZD) on renal function in patients with renal failure (RF) admitted to intensive care units. This was a multicenter, retrospective, comparative cohort study. Renal failure patients were treated with VAN or LZD for proven or suspected infections by multiresistant Gram-positive cocci. Changes in plasma creatinine levels and creatinine clearance at the start and end of treatment were used as endpoints. A total of 147 patients were treated with VAN (group A, n = 68) or LZD (group B, n = 79). Group B included more patients with diabetes mellitus [9 (13.2%) vs. 25 (31.6%); p = 0.007], septic shock [39 (57.4%) vs. 60 (75.9%); p = 0.013] and greater RF (mean ClCr 42.24 ml/min vs. 37.57 ml/min; p = 0.04). Renal function improved in patients from both groups who did not require renal replacement therapy. A greater improvement was seen in group B [percent decrease in Cr (27.94 vs. 9.48; p = 0.02) and percent increase in ClCr (95.96 vs. 55.06; p = 0.05)]. In group A, nine patients (13.2%) experienced an antibiotic-related increase in RF, and antibiotic was discontinued in five patients due to adverse effects. It is reasonable to avoid use of VAN in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.

Gitelman-like syndrome: A rare complication of using aminoglycosides in tuberculosis - A case report. Aminoglycosides are known to cause electrolyte disturbances. Approximately 8-26% of patients who receive an aminoglycoside for several days develop mild renal impairment that is almost always reversible (Brunton et al., 2013). A 46 year old male with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis with resistance to kanamycin is being presented, who was on injectable Capreomycin, Levofloxacin, Ethionamide, Cycloserine, pyrazinamide, linezolid and clofazamine for a period of four months. He presented to us with generalised weakness and pain in the lower limb muscles. Investigation revealed hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalceuria and hypocalcemia. This features mimic Gitelman's syndrome which is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting kidneys causing electrolyte disturbances. The drug was immediately withdrawn and electrolyte correction was given and the condition reversed gradually.

High plasma linezolid concentration and impaired renal function affect development of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is sometimes observed during linezolid therapy. Here, we aimed to investigate the factors affecting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. A prospective observational study was performed between October 2009 and February 2011; 30 patients were included. Plasma linezolid trough concentrations were measured on days 3, 7 and 14 after initial drug administration. Platelet counts and haemoglobin levels were also monitored. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17 patients (56.7%). Median linezolid trough concentrations on day 3 were significantly higher in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) than in patients without renal impairment (14.7 versus 4.8 mg/L; P < 0.0001). Median linezolid trough concentrations on day 3 in patients who developed thrombocytopenia were also significantly higher than those in patients who did not (13.4 versus 4.3 mg/L, P < 0.0001). Development of thrombocytopenia occurred significantly more frequently in patients with linezolid trough concentration >7.5 mg/L (OR, 90.0; P < 0.0001) and renal impairment (OR, 39.0; P = 0.0002). The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the median time from the initiation of therapy to development of thrombocytopenia was 11 days. Patients with renal impairment are more likely to have a high plasma linezolid concentration. In addition, a high plasma linezolid concentration and renal impairment significantly affected the development of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Further studies are required to evaluate whether therapeutic drug monitoring-guided dosage adjustment of linezolid decreases the adverse effects while maintaining treatment efficacy in patients with renal dysfunction.

To describe an indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, we must consider the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes mentioned in the abstracts. While there is no direct mention of a relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid in the provided abstracts, we can infer a potential indirect relationship through the following steps:

1. **Dextroamphetamine's Primary Use**: Dextroamphetamine is primarily used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It's known for its efficacy in improving focus and reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity in patients with ADHD.

2. **Comorbidities with ADHD**: Individuals with ADHD often have comorbid psychiatric conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. The treatment of these comorbid conditions may involve the use of various medications, including antidepressants and anxiolytics.

3. **Linezolid's Use**: Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat certain bacterial infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is particularly useful in treating infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

4. **Potential Intersection**: The indirect relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid could arise in the context of treating patients with ADHD who also have conditions that require the use of linezolid. For instance, a patient with ADHD might develop a bacterial infection that necessitates the use of linezolid. In such cases, the patient would be on both dextroamphetamine for ADHD and linezolid for the bacterial infection.

5. **Consideration of Drug Interactions**: When patients are on multiple medications, there is always a concern about potential drug interactions. Although the abstracts do not specifically mention interactions between dextroamphetamine and linezolid, it is crucial to monitor patients for any adverse effects when they are taking multiple drugs, especially if they have impaired renal function, as linezolid's clearance can be reduced in such cases, potentially leading to higher plasma concentrations and increased risk of side effects like thrombocytopenia.

6. **Psychiatric and Medical Comorbidities**: The management of psychiatric conditions, including ADHD, in patients with medical comorbidities that require antibiotics like linezolid, necessitates careful consideration of the potential impact of these medications on each other and on the patient's overall health. This includes monitoring for signs of drug-induced thrombocytopenia or other hematologic effects associated with linezolid, especially in patients with renal impairment.

In summary, while there is no direct relationship between dextroamphetamine and linezolid mentioned in the abstracts, an indirect relationship can be inferred through the treatment of comorbid conditions in patients with ADHD, the potential for drug interactions, and the need for careful management of patients on multiple medications, particularly when renal function is impaired. Clinicians should be aware of these potential interactions and monitor patients closely to minimize adverse effects.

High dietary consumption of trans fatty acids decreases brain docosahexaenoic acid but does not alter amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease. Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFA) has increased during the 20th century and is a suspected risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. More recently, high TFA intake has been associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the impact of TFA on an animal model genetically programmed to express amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathological markers of AD, we have fed 3xTg-AD mice with either control (0% TFA/total fatty acid), high TFA (16% TFA) or very high TFA (43% TFA) isocaloric diets from 2 to 16 months of age. Effects of TFA on plasma hepatic enzymes, glucose and lipid profile were minimal but very high TFA intake decreased visceral fat of non-transgenic mice. Importantly, dietary TFA increased brain TFA concentrations in a dose-related manner. Very high TFA consumption substantially modified the brain fatty acid profile by increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids and decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Very high TFA intake induced a shift from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) toward n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-6) without altering the n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio in the cortex of both control and 3xTg-AD mice. Changes in levels of Abeta(40), Abeta(42), tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein and synaptic markers were not statistically significant in the three groups of 3xTg-AD mice, despite a trend toward decreased insoluble tau in very high TFA-fed 3xTg-AD animals. In summary, TFA intake modulated brain fatty acid profiles but had no significant effect on major brain neuropathological hallmarks of AD in an animal model.

Nutrient patterns and brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals. Epidemiological evidence linking diet, one of the most important modifiable lifestyle factors, and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly increasing. However, there is little or no evidence for a direct association between dietary nutrients and brain biomarkers of AD. This study identifies nutrient patterns associated with major brain AD biomarkers in a cohort of clinically and cognitively normal (NL) individuals at risk for AD. Cross-sectional study. Manhattan (broader area). Fifty-two NL individuals (age 54+12 y, 70% women, Clinical Dementia Rating=0, MMSE>27, neuropsychological test performance within norms by age and education) with complete dietary information and cross-sectional, 3D T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; gray matter volumes, GMV, a marker of brain atrophy), 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB; a marker of fibrillar amyloid-beta, Abeta) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; a marker of glucose metabolism, METglc) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were examined. Dietary intake of 35 nutrients associated with cognitive function and AD was assessed using the Harvard/Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used to generate nutrient patterns (NP) from the full nutrient panel. Statistical parametric mapping and voxel based morphometry were used to assess the associations of the identified NPs with AD biomarkers. None of the participants were diabetics, smokers, or met criteria for obesity. Five NPs were identified: NP1 was characterized by most B-vitamins and several minerals [VitB and Minerals]; NP2 by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, and vitamin E [VitE and PUFA]; NP3 by vitamin A, vitamin C, carotenoids and dietary fibers [Anti-oxidants and Fibers]; NP4 by vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc [VitB12 and D]; NP5 by saturated, trans-saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium [Fats]. Voxel-based analysis showed that NP4 scores [VitB12 and D] were positively associated with METglc and GMV, and negatively associated with PiB retention in AD-vulnerable regions (p<0.001). In addition, both METglc and GMV were positively associated with NP2 scores [VitE and PUFA], and negatively associated with NP5 scores [Fats] (p<0.001), and METglc was positively associated with higher NP3 scores [Anti-oxidants and Fibers] (p<0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education, caloric intake, BMI, alcohol consumption, family history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status did not attenuate these relationships. The identified 'AD-protective' nutrient combination was associated with higher intake of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairies, and lower intake of sweets, fried potatoes, high-fat dairies, processed meat and butter. Specific dietary NPs are associated with brain biomarkers of AD in NL individuals, suggesting that dietary interventions may play a role in the prevention of AD by modulating AD-risk through its effects on Abeta and associated neuronal impairment.

Plasma fatty acid lipidomics in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 series have been linked to brain physiology and cognitive decline, but little is known about the other components of the complex fatty acids category. Here, we compared 30 molecular species pertaining to saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids, measured in plasma by gas chromatography, in 14 patients with a diagnosis of amnestic single domain mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 30 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 30 healthy controls (HC). As no participants showed neuroimaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease, patients could be considered as purely neurodegenerative. We found differences in specific components of almost all fatty acid classes except n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. Compared with HC, aMCI and AD patients had higher levels of arachidic (C20:0), erucic (C22:1, n-9), and vaccenic acid (C18:1, n-9) and lower levels of cerotic (C26:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2, n-6). In particular, level of linoleic acid decreased and level of mead acid increased progressively from HC to aMCI to AD patients, and they were also inversely correlated in AD and aMCI patients. In conclusion, we found a previously unrecognized linoleic acid deficiency in the early phase of neurodegeneration that was strongly supported by an increased, compensatory mead acid level. These findings suggest the importance of creating new dietary manipulation strategies to counteract disease progression.

Trans fatty acids enhance amyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP). Hydrogenation of oils and diary products of ruminant animals leads to an increasing amount of trans fatty acids in the human diet. Trans fatty acids are incorporated in several lipids and accumulate in the membrane of cells. Here we systematically investigate whether the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is affected by trans fatty acids compared to the cis conformation. Our experiments clearly show that trans fatty acids compared to cis fatty acids increase amyloidogenic and decrease nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, resulting in an increased production of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, main components of senile plaques, which are a characteristic neuropathological hallmark for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, our results show that oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta are increased by trans fatty acids. The mechanisms identified by this in vitro study suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids potentially increases the AD risk or causes an earlier onset of the disease.

Relation of the tocopherol forms to incident Alzheimer disease and to cognitive change. High intake of vitamin E from food (tocopherol), but not from supplements (which usually contain alpha-tocopherol), is inversely associated with Alzheimer disease. We examined whether food intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents (a measure of the relative biologic activity of tocopherols and tocotrienols), or individual tocopherols would protect against incident Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline over 6 y in participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project. The 1993-2002 study of community residents aged >or=65 y included the administration of 4 cognitive tests and clinical evaluations for Alzheimer disease. Dietary assessment was by food-frequency questionnaire. Tocopherol intake from food was related to the 4-y incidence of Alzheimer disease determined by logistic regression in 1041 participants who were clinically evaluated (n=162 incident cases) and to change in a global cognitive score determined by mixed models in 3718 participants. Higher intakes of vitamin E (relative risk: 0.74 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.88) and alpha-tocopherol equivalents (relative risk: 0.56 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.98) were associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease in separate multiple-adjusted models that included intakes of saturated and trans fats and docosahexaenoic acid. alpha- and gamma-Tocopherol had independent associations. In separate mixed models, a slower rate of cognitive decline was associated with intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherols. The results suggest that various tocopherol forms rather than alpha- tocopherol alone may be important in the vitamin E protective association with Alzheimer disease.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

Determination of trans-fatty acids in food samples based on the precolumn fluorescence derivatization by high performance liquid chromatography.  Trans-fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids that are considered to have health risks.  1,3,5,7-Tetramethyl-8-butyrethylenediamine-difluoroboradiaza-s-indacene is a highly sensitive fluorescent labeling reagent for carboxylic acids developed by our lab.  In this study, using this precolumn fluorescent derivatization reagent, a rapid and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method was developed for the determination of two trans-fatty acids in food samples.  Under the optimized derivative conditions, two trans-fatty acids were tagged with the fluorescent labeling reagent in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide at 25 degrees C for 30 min.  Then, the baseline separation of trans- and cis-fatty acids and their saturated fatty acid with similar structures was achieved with less interference using a reversed-phased C18 column with isocratic elution in 14 min.  With fluorescence detection at lambdaex /lambdaem  = 490 /510 nm, the linear range of the TFAs was 1.0-200 nM with low detection limits in the range of 0.1-0.2 nM (signal-to-noise ratio = 3).  In addition, the proposed approach was successfully applied for the detection of trans-fatty acids in food samples, and the recoveries using this method ranged from 96.02 to 109.22% with low relative standard deviations of 1.2-4.3% (n = 6).

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Brain Fatty Acid Profiles**: The F3 wt Allele could influence dietary preferences or metabolism, leading to altered intake or processing of fatty acids. This, in turn, could affect brain fatty acid profiles, as seen in studies where high dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs) modified brain fatty acid profiles without directly altering amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in an Alzheimer's disease model (Abstract 1). The brain's fatty acid composition, particularly the balance between omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is crucial for brain function and has been linked to cognitive decline and AD (Abstract 3).

2. **Trans Fatty Acids and Amyloidogenic Processing**: Trans fatty acids, which can be influenced by dietary habits potentially linked to the F3 wt Allele, have been shown to enhance amyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased production of amyloid-beta peptides, a hallmark of AD (Abstract 4). This suggests a pathway where dietary factors, possibly influenced by genetic predispositions like the F3 wt Allele, could indirectly contribute to AD pathology through the modulation of brain fatty acid profiles and APP processing.

3. **Vitamin E and Tocopherol Forms**: The relationship between vitamin E intake and AD risk (Abstract 5) introduces another potential pathway. If the F3 wt Allele influences vitamin E metabolism or dietary intake, this could impact AD risk. Vitamin E, particularly in its various tocopherol forms, has been associated with a reduced incidence of AD, possibly through antioxidant effects that protect against neuronal damage.

4. **Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Pathways**: The connection between trans fatty acid consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Abstracts 6 and 7) is relevant because T2D is a known risk factor for AD. An indirect relationship could exist if the F3 wt Allele affects metabolic pathways or dietary preferences that increase T2D risk, thereby indirectly influencing AD risk.

5. **Gut-Brain Axis and Fatty Acid Modulation**: The modulation of the gut-brain axis by different types of fatty acids (Abstract 8) suggests another potential mechanism. The F3 wt Allele could influence fatty acid metabolism or preference, affecting the gut-brain axis and, by extension, cognitive health and AD risk.

6. **Detection and Dietary Assessment of Trans Fatty Acids**: The development of methods for detecting trans fatty acids in food samples (Abstract 9) underscores the importance of accurately assessing dietary intake of these fatty acids. If the F3 wt Allele is associated with preferences for or metabolic handling of dietary fats, accurate detection methods could help elucidate indirect relationships between the allele, dietary fatty acid intake, and AD risk.

In summary, while the abstracts do not directly link the F3 wt Allele to Alzheimer's Disease, they suggest several indirect pathways through which such a relationship could exist. These pathways involve dietary fatty acids, brain fatty acid profiles, amyloidogenic processing, vitamin E metabolism, type 2 diabetes risk, and modulation of the gut-brain axis. Further research would be necessary to establish whether the F3 wt Allele indeed influences these factors and, by extension, AD risk.

High dietary consumption of trans fatty acids decreases brain docosahexaenoic acid but does not alter amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease. Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFA) has increased during the 20th century and is a suspected risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. More recently, high TFA intake has been associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the impact of TFA on an animal model genetically programmed to express amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathological markers of AD, we have fed 3xTg-AD mice with either control (0% TFA/total fatty acid), high TFA (16% TFA) or very high TFA (43% TFA) isocaloric diets from 2 to 16 months of age. Effects of TFA on plasma hepatic enzymes, glucose and lipid profile were minimal but very high TFA intake decreased visceral fat of non-transgenic mice. Importantly, dietary TFA increased brain TFA concentrations in a dose-related manner. Very high TFA consumption substantially modified the brain fatty acid profile by increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids and decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Very high TFA intake induced a shift from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) toward n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-6) without altering the n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio in the cortex of both control and 3xTg-AD mice. Changes in levels of Abeta(40), Abeta(42), tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein and synaptic markers were not statistically significant in the three groups of 3xTg-AD mice, despite a trend toward decreased insoluble tau in very high TFA-fed 3xTg-AD animals. In summary, TFA intake modulated brain fatty acid profiles but had no significant effect on major brain neuropathological hallmarks of AD in an animal model.

Nutrient patterns and brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals. Epidemiological evidence linking diet, one of the most important modifiable lifestyle factors, and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly increasing. However, there is little or no evidence for a direct association between dietary nutrients and brain biomarkers of AD. This study identifies nutrient patterns associated with major brain AD biomarkers in a cohort of clinically and cognitively normal (NL) individuals at risk for AD. Cross-sectional study. Manhattan (broader area). Fifty-two NL individuals (age 54+12 y, 70% women, Clinical Dementia Rating=0, MMSE>27, neuropsychological test performance within norms by age and education) with complete dietary information and cross-sectional, 3D T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; gray matter volumes, GMV, a marker of brain atrophy), 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB; a marker of fibrillar amyloid-beta, Abeta) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; a marker of glucose metabolism, METglc) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were examined. Dietary intake of 35 nutrients associated with cognitive function and AD was assessed using the Harvard/Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used to generate nutrient patterns (NP) from the full nutrient panel. Statistical parametric mapping and voxel based morphometry were used to assess the associations of the identified NPs with AD biomarkers. None of the participants were diabetics, smokers, or met criteria for obesity. Five NPs were identified: NP1 was characterized by most B-vitamins and several minerals [VitB and Minerals]; NP2 by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, and vitamin E [VitE and PUFA]; NP3 by vitamin A, vitamin C, carotenoids and dietary fibers [Anti-oxidants and Fibers]; NP4 by vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc [VitB12 and D]; NP5 by saturated, trans-saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium [Fats]. Voxel-based analysis showed that NP4 scores [VitB12 and D] were positively associated with METglc and GMV, and negatively associated with PiB retention in AD-vulnerable regions (p<0.001). In addition, both METglc and GMV were positively associated with NP2 scores [VitE and PUFA], and negatively associated with NP5 scores [Fats] (p<0.001), and METglc was positively associated with higher NP3 scores [Anti-oxidants and Fibers] (p<0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education, caloric intake, BMI, alcohol consumption, family history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status did not attenuate these relationships. The identified 'AD-protective' nutrient combination was associated with higher intake of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairies, and lower intake of sweets, fried potatoes, high-fat dairies, processed meat and butter. Specific dietary NPs are associated with brain biomarkers of AD in NL individuals, suggesting that dietary interventions may play a role in the prevention of AD by modulating AD-risk through its effects on Abeta and associated neuronal impairment.

Plasma fatty acid lipidomics in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 series have been linked to brain physiology and cognitive decline, but little is known about the other components of the complex fatty acids category. Here, we compared 30 molecular species pertaining to saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids, measured in plasma by gas chromatography, in 14 patients with a diagnosis of amnestic single domain mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 30 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 30 healthy controls (HC). As no participants showed neuroimaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease, patients could be considered as purely neurodegenerative. We found differences in specific components of almost all fatty acid classes except n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. Compared with HC, aMCI and AD patients had higher levels of arachidic (C20:0), erucic (C22:1, n-9), and vaccenic acid (C18:1, n-9) and lower levels of cerotic (C26:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2, n-6). In particular, level of linoleic acid decreased and level of mead acid increased progressively from HC to aMCI to AD patients, and they were also inversely correlated in AD and aMCI patients. In conclusion, we found a previously unrecognized linoleic acid deficiency in the early phase of neurodegeneration that was strongly supported by an increased, compensatory mead acid level. These findings suggest the importance of creating new dietary manipulation strategies to counteract disease progression.

Trans fatty acids enhance amyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP). Hydrogenation of oils and diary products of ruminant animals leads to an increasing amount of trans fatty acids in the human diet. Trans fatty acids are incorporated in several lipids and accumulate in the membrane of cells. Here we systematically investigate whether the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is affected by trans fatty acids compared to the cis conformation. Our experiments clearly show that trans fatty acids compared to cis fatty acids increase amyloidogenic and decrease nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, resulting in an increased production of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, main components of senile plaques, which are a characteristic neuropathological hallmark for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, our results show that oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta are increased by trans fatty acids. The mechanisms identified by this in vitro study suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids potentially increases the AD risk or causes an earlier onset of the disease.

Relation of the tocopherol forms to incident Alzheimer disease and to cognitive change. High intake of vitamin E from food (tocopherol), but not from supplements (which usually contain alpha-tocopherol), is inversely associated with Alzheimer disease. We examined whether food intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents (a measure of the relative biologic activity of tocopherols and tocotrienols), or individual tocopherols would protect against incident Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline over 6 y in participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project. The 1993-2002 study of community residents aged >or=65 y included the administration of 4 cognitive tests and clinical evaluations for Alzheimer disease. Dietary assessment was by food-frequency questionnaire. Tocopherol intake from food was related to the 4-y incidence of Alzheimer disease determined by logistic regression in 1041 participants who were clinically evaluated (n=162 incident cases) and to change in a global cognitive score determined by mixed models in 3718 participants. Higher intakes of vitamin E (relative risk: 0.74 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.88) and alpha-tocopherol equivalents (relative risk: 0.56 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.98) were associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease in separate multiple-adjusted models that included intakes of saturated and trans fats and docosahexaenoic acid. alpha- and gamma-Tocopherol had independent associations. In separate mixed models, a slower rate of cognitive decline was associated with intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherols. The results suggest that various tocopherol forms rather than alpha- tocopherol alone may be important in the vitamin E protective association with Alzheimer disease.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

Determination of trans-fatty acids in food samples based on the precolumn fluorescence derivatization by high performance liquid chromatography.  Trans-fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids that are considered to have health risks.  1,3,5,7-Tetramethyl-8-butyrethylenediamine-difluoroboradiaza-s-indacene is a highly sensitive fluorescent labeling reagent for carboxylic acids developed by our lab.  In this study, using this precolumn fluorescent derivatization reagent, a rapid and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method was developed for the determination of two trans-fatty acids in food samples.  Under the optimized derivative conditions, two trans-fatty acids were tagged with the fluorescent labeling reagent in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide at 25 degrees C for 30 min.  Then, the baseline separation of trans- and cis-fatty acids and their saturated fatty acid with similar structures was achieved with less interference using a reversed-phased C18 column with isocratic elution in 14 min.  With fluorescence detection at lambdaex /lambdaem  = 490 /510 nm, the linear range of the TFAs was 1.0-200 nM with low detection limits in the range of 0.1-0.2 nM (signal-to-noise ratio = 3).  In addition, the proposed approach was successfully applied for the detection of trans-fatty acids in food samples, and the recoveries using this method ranged from 96.02 to 109.22% with low relative standard deviations of 1.2-4.3% (n = 6). 

Exploring the relationship between trans fatty acids and body fat distribution.  The importance of fat distribution is well established.  Nevertheless, the mechanism by which fat is distributed throughout the trunk and limbs remains unclear.  The aim of this study was to uncover the relationship between 4 trans fatty acids (TFAs) and body fat distribution in the trunk and limbs.  The study examined 1467 participants registered in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database between 1999 and 2000.  A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between TFA and body fat distribution over the trunk and limbs.  In the unadjusted model for men, trunk fat percentage was significantly associated with trans 9-hexadecenoic acid (beta = 0.250; 95% CI, 0.187-0.313; P <0.01), trans 11-octadecenoic acid (beta = 0.927; 95% CI, 0.499-1.356; P <0.01), trans 9-octadecenoic acid (beta = 1.028; 95% CI, 0.654-1.402; P <0.01), and trans 9, trans 12-octadienoic acid (beta = 0.078; 95% CI, 0.054-0.103; P <0.01).  No significant association was found between limb fat percentage and TFA.  Our study demonstrated that increased TFA concentration was associated with fat deposition predominantly in the trunk rather than in the limbs.  Further research is needed to investigate the role of TFA in different body fat distributions.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms:

1. **Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs)**: High dietary intake of TFAs has been associated with an increased risk of developing AD. TFAs can alter brain fatty acid profiles, decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids. This shift in fatty acid composition may contribute to the development of AD.
2. **Influence of TFAs on amyloidogenic processing of APP**: TFAs have been shown to enhance the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to an increased production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD.
3. **Association between TFAs and body fat distribution**: TFAs have been linked to fat deposition in the trunk area, which may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, a known risk factor for AD.
4. **Impact of TFAs on cognitive decline**: Some studies suggest that TFAs may be associated with cognitive decline, which is a precursor to AD.
5. **Role of vitamin E and other nutrients**: Vitamin E, particularly alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol, has been shown to have a protective effect against AD. A diet rich in vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, and other nutrients may help mitigate the risk of AD.
6. **F3 wt Allele and lipid metabolism**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, the F3 wt Allele may be involved in lipid metabolism, which could influence the development of AD. For example, the F3 gene is involved in the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and alterations in lipid metabolism may contribute to the development of AD.

The potential indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD could be mediated by the following intermediate entities or processes:

* Dietary consumption of TFAs
* Alterations in brain fatty acid profiles
* Enhanced amyloidogenic processing of APP
* Body fat distribution and metabolic disorders
* Cognitive decline
* Lipid metabolism and coagulation pathways

In summary, while there is no direct evidence linking the F3 wt Allele to AD, the provided abstracts suggest that an indirect relationship may exist through the influence of dietary TFAs, alterations in lipid metabolism, and the subsequent development of metabolic disorders and cognitive decline. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.

High dietary consumption of trans fatty acids decreases brain docosahexaenoic acid but does not alter amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease. Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFA) has increased during the 20th century and is a suspected risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. More recently, high TFA intake has been associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the impact of TFA on an animal model genetically programmed to express amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathological markers of AD, we have fed 3xTg-AD mice with either control (0% TFA/total fatty acid), high TFA (16% TFA) or very high TFA (43% TFA) isocaloric diets from 2 to 16 months of age. Effects of TFA on plasma hepatic enzymes, glucose and lipid profile were minimal but very high TFA intake decreased visceral fat of non-transgenic mice. Importantly, dietary TFA increased brain TFA concentrations in a dose-related manner. Very high TFA consumption substantially modified the brain fatty acid profile by increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids and decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Very high TFA intake induced a shift from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) toward n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-6) without altering the n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio in the cortex of both control and 3xTg-AD mice. Changes in levels of Abeta(40), Abeta(42), tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein and synaptic markers were not statistically significant in the three groups of 3xTg-AD mice, despite a trend toward decreased insoluble tau in very high TFA-fed 3xTg-AD animals. In summary, TFA intake modulated brain fatty acid profiles but had no significant effect on major brain neuropathological hallmarks of AD in an animal model.

Nutrient patterns and brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals. Epidemiological evidence linking diet, one of the most important modifiable lifestyle factors, and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly increasing. However, there is little or no evidence for a direct association between dietary nutrients and brain biomarkers of AD. This study identifies nutrient patterns associated with major brain AD biomarkers in a cohort of clinically and cognitively normal (NL) individuals at risk for AD. Cross-sectional study. Manhattan (broader area). Fifty-two NL individuals (age 54+12 y, 70% women, Clinical Dementia Rating=0, MMSE>27, neuropsychological test performance within norms by age and education) with complete dietary information and cross-sectional, 3D T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; gray matter volumes, GMV, a marker of brain atrophy), 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB; a marker of fibrillar amyloid-beta, Abeta) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; a marker of glucose metabolism, METglc) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were examined. Dietary intake of 35 nutrients associated with cognitive function and AD was assessed using the Harvard/Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used to generate nutrient patterns (NP) from the full nutrient panel. Statistical parametric mapping and voxel based morphometry were used to assess the associations of the identified NPs with AD biomarkers. None of the participants were diabetics, smokers, or met criteria for obesity. Five NPs were identified: NP1 was characterized by most B-vitamins and several minerals [VitB and Minerals]; NP2 by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, and vitamin E [VitE and PUFA]; NP3 by vitamin A, vitamin C, carotenoids and dietary fibers [Anti-oxidants and Fibers]; NP4 by vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc [VitB12 and D]; NP5 by saturated, trans-saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium [Fats]. Voxel-based analysis showed that NP4 scores [VitB12 and D] were positively associated with METglc and GMV, and negatively associated with PiB retention in AD-vulnerable regions (p<0.001). In addition, both METglc and GMV were positively associated with NP2 scores [VitE and PUFA], and negatively associated with NP5 scores [Fats] (p<0.001), and METglc was positively associated with higher NP3 scores [Anti-oxidants and Fibers] (p<0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education, caloric intake, BMI, alcohol consumption, family history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status did not attenuate these relationships. The identified 'AD-protective' nutrient combination was associated with higher intake of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairies, and lower intake of sweets, fried potatoes, high-fat dairies, processed meat and butter. Specific dietary NPs are associated with brain biomarkers of AD in NL individuals, suggesting that dietary interventions may play a role in the prevention of AD by modulating AD-risk through its effects on Abeta and associated neuronal impairment.

Plasma fatty acid lipidomics in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 series have been linked to brain physiology and cognitive decline, but little is known about the other components of the complex fatty acids category. Here, we compared 30 molecular species pertaining to saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids, measured in plasma by gas chromatography, in 14 patients with a diagnosis of amnestic single domain mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 30 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 30 healthy controls (HC). As no participants showed neuroimaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease, patients could be considered as purely neurodegenerative. We found differences in specific components of almost all fatty acid classes except n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. Compared with HC, aMCI and AD patients had higher levels of arachidic (C20:0), erucic (C22:1, n-9), and vaccenic acid (C18:1, n-9) and lower levels of cerotic (C26:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2, n-6). In particular, level of linoleic acid decreased and level of mead acid increased progressively from HC to aMCI to AD patients, and they were also inversely correlated in AD and aMCI patients. In conclusion, we found a previously unrecognized linoleic acid deficiency in the early phase of neurodegeneration that was strongly supported by an increased, compensatory mead acid level. These findings suggest the importance of creating new dietary manipulation strategies to counteract disease progression.

Trans fatty acids enhance amyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP). Hydrogenation of oils and diary products of ruminant animals leads to an increasing amount of trans fatty acids in the human diet. Trans fatty acids are incorporated in several lipids and accumulate in the membrane of cells. Here we systematically investigate whether the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is affected by trans fatty acids compared to the cis conformation. Our experiments clearly show that trans fatty acids compared to cis fatty acids increase amyloidogenic and decrease nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, resulting in an increased production of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, main components of senile plaques, which are a characteristic neuropathological hallmark for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, our results show that oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta are increased by trans fatty acids. The mechanisms identified by this in vitro study suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids potentially increases the AD risk or causes an earlier onset of the disease.

Relation of the tocopherol forms to incident Alzheimer disease and to cognitive change. High intake of vitamin E from food (tocopherol), but not from supplements (which usually contain alpha-tocopherol), is inversely associated with Alzheimer disease. We examined whether food intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents (a measure of the relative biologic activity of tocopherols and tocotrienols), or individual tocopherols would protect against incident Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline over 6 y in participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project. The 1993-2002 study of community residents aged >or=65 y included the administration of 4 cognitive tests and clinical evaluations for Alzheimer disease. Dietary assessment was by food-frequency questionnaire. Tocopherol intake from food was related to the 4-y incidence of Alzheimer disease determined by logistic regression in 1041 participants who were clinically evaluated (n=162 incident cases) and to change in a global cognitive score determined by mixed models in 3718 participants. Higher intakes of vitamin E (relative risk: 0.74 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.88) and alpha-tocopherol equivalents (relative risk: 0.56 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.98) were associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease in separate multiple-adjusted models that included intakes of saturated and trans fats and docosahexaenoic acid. alpha- and gamma-Tocopherol had independent associations. In separate mixed models, a slower rate of cognitive decline was associated with intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherols. The results suggest that various tocopherol forms rather than alpha- tocopherol alone may be important in the vitamin E protective association with Alzheimer disease.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels.

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.

The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

Exploring the relationship between trans fatty acids and body fat distribution.  The importance of fat distribution is well established.  Nevertheless, the mechanism by which fat is distributed throughout the trunk and limbs remains unclear.  The aim of this study was to uncover the relationship between 4 trans fatty acids (TFAs) and body fat distribution in the trunk and limbs.  The study examined 1467 participants registered in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database between 1999 and 2000.  A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between TFA and body fat distribution over the trunk and limbs.  In the unadjusted model for men, trunk fat percentage was significantly associated with trans 9-hexadecenoic acid (beta = 0.250; 95% CI, 0.187-0.313; P <0.01), trans 11-octadecenoic acid (beta = 0.927; 95% CI, 0.499-1.356; P <0.01), trans 9-octadecenoic acid (beta = 1.028; 95% CI, 0.654-1.402; P <0.01), and trans 9, trans 12-octadienoic acid (beta = 0.078; 95% CI, 0.054-0.103; P <0.01).  No significant association was found between limb fat percentage and TFA.  Our study demonstrated that increased TFA concentration was associated with fat deposition predominantly in the trunk rather than in the limbs.  Further research is needed to investigate the role of TFA in different body fat distributions. 

Content of industrially produced trans fatty acids in breast milk: An observational study.  Breast milk may contain industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs), which can affect the content of essential fatty acids (EFAs).  This could have significant implications for the child's development.  The fatty acids present in breast milk can be modified by adjusting the mother's diet.  The objective of this study was to determine the content of industrially produced TFAs present in colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk produced by mothers between 18 and 45 years of age in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, based on a longitudinal observational study.  The TFA content in the breast milk of 33 lactating women was analyzed using gas chromatography.  The mothers' consumption of TFAs was also estimated by analyzing a log prepared through 24-hr dietary recall (24HR) obtained in each period.  The TFA content in the mothers' diet was similar across the colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk phases: 1.64 +/- 1.25 g, 1.39 +/- 1.01, and 1.66 +/- 1.13 g, respectively.  The total TFA content was 1.529% +/- 1.648% for colostrum; 0.748% +/- 1.033% for transitional milk and 0.945% +/- 1.368% for mature milk.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Brain Fatty Acid Profile**: The F3 wt Allele could influence dietary preferences or metabolism, leading to an altered intake of fatty acids, such as trans fatty acids (TFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). This, in turn, could modify the brain fatty acid profile, as seen in the study where high TFA consumption decreased brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. A decreased DHA level has been linked to cognitive decline and AD.

2. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. TFAs, which are known to induce inflammation and oxidative stress, could exacerbate this condition, contributing to the development of AD. The molecular mechanisms underlying the toxic actions of TFAs, including cell death and inflammation, could play a crucial role in this process.

3. **Amyloid-Beta Processing and Aggregation**: The F3 wt Allele could influence the processing and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD. TFAs have been shown to enhance the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased production of Aβ peptides. This could contribute to the formation of senile plaques, a characteristic neuropathological feature of AD.

4. **Vitamin E and Tocopherol Forms**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism or absorption of vitamin E and its various forms, such as alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol. These tocopherol forms have been shown to have protective effects against AD, and their altered levels could influence the risk of developing the disease.

5. **Body Fat Distribution and Metabolic Factors**: The F3 wt Allele could influence body fat distribution, particularly in the trunk area, which has been linked to an increased risk of AD. TFAs have been shown to contribute to fat deposition in the trunk area, and this could be an intermediate factor in the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.

6. **Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome, which are known risk factors for AD. TFAs have been shown to have both positive and negative associations with T2D risk, depending on their conformation and source (industrial or ruminant).

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve a complex interplay of dietary fatty acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, amyloid-beta processing, vitamin E metabolism, body fat distribution, and metabolic factors. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and intermediate entities involved in this relationship.

High dietary consumption of trans fatty acids decreases brain docosahexaenoic acid but does not alter amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease. Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFA) has increased during the 20th century and is a suspected risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. More recently, high TFA intake has been associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the impact of TFA on an animal model genetically programmed to express amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathological markers of AD, we have fed 3xTg-AD mice with either control (0% TFA/total fatty acid), high TFA (16% TFA) or very high TFA (43% TFA) isocaloric diets from 2 to 16 months of age. Effects of TFA on plasma hepatic enzymes, glucose and lipid profile were minimal but very high TFA intake decreased visceral fat of non-transgenic mice. Importantly, dietary TFA increased brain TFA concentrations in a dose-related manner. Very high TFA consumption substantially modified the brain fatty acid profile by increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids and decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Very high TFA intake induced a shift from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) toward n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-6) without altering the n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio in the cortex of both control and 3xTg-AD mice. Changes in levels of Abeta(40), Abeta(42), tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein and synaptic markers were not statistically significant in the three groups of 3xTg-AD mice, despite a trend toward decreased insoluble tau in very high TFA-fed 3xTg-AD animals. In summary, TFA intake modulated brain fatty acid profiles but had no significant effect on major brain neuropathological hallmarks of AD in an animal model.

Nutrient patterns and brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals. Epidemiological evidence linking diet, one of the most important modifiable lifestyle factors, and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly increasing. However, there is little or no evidence for a direct association between dietary nutrients and brain biomarkers of AD. This study identifies nutrient patterns associated with major brain AD biomarkers in a cohort of clinically and cognitively normal (NL) individuals at risk for AD. Cross-sectional study. Manhattan (broader area). Fifty-two NL individuals (age 54+12 y, 70% women, Clinical Dementia Rating=0, MMSE>27, neuropsychological test performance within norms by age and education) with complete dietary information and cross-sectional, 3D T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; gray matter volumes, GMV, a marker of brain atrophy), 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB; a marker of fibrillar amyloid-beta, Abeta) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; a marker of glucose metabolism, METglc) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were examined. Dietary intake of 35 nutrients associated with cognitive function and AD was assessed using the Harvard/Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used to generate nutrient patterns (NP) from the full nutrient panel. Statistical parametric mapping and voxel based morphometry were used to assess the associations of the identified NPs with AD biomarkers. None of the participants were diabetics, smokers, or met criteria for obesity. Five NPs were identified: NP1 was characterized by most B-vitamins and several minerals [VitB and Minerals]; NP2 by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, and vitamin E [VitE and PUFA]; NP3 by vitamin A, vitamin C, carotenoids and dietary fibers [Anti-oxidants and Fibers]; NP4 by vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc [VitB12 and D]; NP5 by saturated, trans-saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium [Fats]. Voxel-based analysis showed that NP4 scores [VitB12 and D] were positively associated with METglc and GMV, and negatively associated with PiB retention in AD-vulnerable regions (p<0.001). In addition, both METglc and GMV were positively associated with NP2 scores [VitE and PUFA], and negatively associated with NP5 scores [Fats] (p<0.001), and METglc was positively associated with higher NP3 scores [Anti-oxidants and Fibers] (p<0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education, caloric intake, BMI, alcohol consumption, family history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status did not attenuate these relationships. The identified 'AD-protective' nutrient combination was associated with higher intake of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairies, and lower intake of sweets, fried potatoes, high-fat dairies, processed meat and butter. Specific dietary NPs are associated with brain biomarkers of AD in NL individuals, suggesting that dietary interventions may play a role in the prevention of AD by modulating AD-risk through its effects on Abeta and associated neuronal impairment.

Trans fatty acids enhance amyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP). Hydrogenation of oils and diary products of ruminant animals leads to an increasing amount of trans fatty acids in the human diet. Trans fatty acids are incorporated in several lipids and accumulate in the membrane of cells. Here we systematically investigate whether the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is affected by trans fatty acids compared to the cis conformation. Our experiments clearly show that trans fatty acids compared to cis fatty acids increase amyloidogenic and decrease nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, resulting in an increased production of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, main components of senile plaques, which are a characteristic neuropathological hallmark for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, our results show that oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta are increased by trans fatty acids. The mechanisms identified by this in vitro study suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids potentially increases the AD risk or causes an earlier onset of the disease.

Relation of the tocopherol forms to incident Alzheimer disease and to cognitive change. High intake of vitamin E from food (tocopherol), but not from supplements (which usually contain alpha-tocopherol), is inversely associated with Alzheimer disease. We examined whether food intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents (a measure of the relative biologic activity of tocopherols and tocotrienols), or individual tocopherols would protect against incident Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline over 6 y in participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project. The 1993-2002 study of community residents aged >or=65 y included the administration of 4 cognitive tests and clinical evaluations for Alzheimer disease. Dietary assessment was by food-frequency questionnaire. Tocopherol intake from food was related to the 4-y incidence of Alzheimer disease determined by logistic regression in 1041 participants who were clinically evaluated (n=162 incident cases) and to change in a global cognitive score determined by mixed models in 3718 participants. Higher intakes of vitamin E (relative risk: 0.74 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.88) and alpha-tocopherol equivalents (relative risk: 0.56 per 5 mg/d increase; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.98) were associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease in separate multiple-adjusted models that included intakes of saturated and trans fats and docosahexaenoic acid. alpha- and gamma-Tocopherol had independent associations. In separate mixed models, a slower rate of cognitive decline was associated with intakes of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol equivalents, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherols. The results suggest that various tocopherol forms rather than alpha- tocopherol alone may be important in the vitamin E protective association with Alzheimer disease.

Japanese, Mediterranean and Argentinean diets and their potential roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental factors are responsible of cellular senescence and processes found in the development of cognitive disorders. The aim of this paper is to compare benefits of the Japanese, Mediterranean, and Argentinian Diet on the onset or prevention of senile dementia (SD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Special focus was on the effects of specific compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), antioxidants, and saturated and trans fatty acids. A high adherence to diets rich in PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and antioxidants may decrease the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases; while the predominance of saturated and trans fatty acids possibly rises it.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

Exploring the relationship between trans fatty acids and body fat distribution.  The importance of fat distribution is well established.  Nevertheless, the mechanism by which fat is distributed throughout the trunk and limbs remains unclear.  The aim of this study was to uncover the relationship between 4 trans fatty acids (TFAs) and body fat distribution in the trunk and limbs.  The study examined 1467 participants registered in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database between 1999 and 2000.  A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between TFA and body fat distribution over the trunk and limbs.  In the unadjusted model for men, trunk fat percentage was significantly associated with trans 9-hexadecenoic acid (beta = 0.250; 95% CI, 0.187-0.313; P <0.01), trans 11-octadecenoic acid (beta = 0.927; 95% CI, 0.499-1.356; P <0.01), trans 9-octadecenoic acid (beta = 1.028; 95% CI, 0.654-1.402; P <0.01), and trans 9, trans 12-octadienoic acid (beta = 0.078; 95% CI, 0.054-0.103; P <0.01).  No significant association was found between limb fat percentage and TFA.  Our study demonstrated that increased TFA concentration was associated with fat deposition predominantly in the trunk rather than in the limbs.  Further research is needed to investigate the role of TFA in different body fat distributions. 

Content of industrially produced trans fatty acids in breast milk: An observational study.  Breast milk may contain industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs), which can affect the content of essential fatty acids (EFAs).  This could have significant implications for the child's development.  The fatty acids present in breast milk can be modified by adjusting the mother's diet.  The objective of this study was to determine the content of industrially produced TFAs present in colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk produced by mothers between 18 and 45 years of age in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, based on a longitudinal observational study.  The TFA content in the breast milk of 33 lactating women was analyzed using gas chromatography.  The mothers' consumption of TFAs was also estimated by analyzing a log prepared through 24-hr dietary recall (24HR) obtained in each period.  The TFA content in the mothers' diet was similar across the colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk phases: 1.64 +/- 1.25 g, 1.39 +/- 1.01, and 1.66 +/- 1.13 g, respectively.  The total TFA content was 1.529% +/- 1.648% for colostrum; 0.748% +/- 1.033% for transitional milk and 0.945% +/- 1.368% for mature milk.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Dietary consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs)**: TFAs have been associated with an increased risk of AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence dietary preferences or metabolism, leading to increased TFA consumption.
2. **Brain fatty acid profile modification**: High TFA intake can modify the brain fatty acid profile, decreasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and increasing mono-unsaturated fatty acids. This alteration might contribute to AD development.
3. **Amyloidogenic processing of APP**: TFAs can enhance the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD.
4. **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: TFAs can induce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known to contribute to AD pathogenesis.
5. **Vitamin E and tocopherol forms**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism or absorption of vitamin E and tocopherol forms, which have been shown to have a protective association with AD.
6. **Body fat distribution**: TFAs have been linked to increased trunk fat percentage, which might be associated with an increased risk of AD.
7. **Industrial and ruminant TFAs**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the metabolism or absorption of different types of TFAs, which have varying effects on AD risk.

The potential indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD can be illustrated as follows:

F3 wt Allele → Dietary preferences/metabolism → TFA consumption → Brain fatty acid profile modification → Amyloidogenic processing of APP → Inflammation and oxidative stress → AD development

Alternatively, the relationship could be:

F3 wt Allele → Vitamin E/tocopherol metabolism → AD protection → AD development

Or:

F3 wt Allele → Body fat distribution → AD risk

These hypothetical relationships highlight the potential indirect connections between the F3 wt Allele and AD, mediated by various intermediate entities and mechanisms. However, it is essential to note that the provided abstracts do not directly investigate the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD, and further research is necessary to establish a clear connection.

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and the Underlying Altered Fatty Acid Metabolism, Reveals Brain Hypoperfusion and Contributes to the Cognitive Decline in APP/PS1 Mice. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of chronic liver disease, is associated with cognitive decline in middle-aged adults, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. We hypothesized that NAFLD would unveil the appearance of brain hypoperfusion in association with altered plasma and brain lipid metabolism. To test our hypothesis, amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat, cholesterol and cholate diet, inducing NAFLD without obesity and hyperglycemia. The diet-induced NAFLD disturbed monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid (MUFAs, PUFAs) metabolism in the plasma, liver, and brain, and particularly reduced n-3 PUFAs levels. These alterations in lipid homeostasis were associated in the brain with an increased expression of Tnfalpha, Cox2, p21, and Nox2, reminiscent of brain inflammation, senescence, and oxidative stress. In addition, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, while brain perfusion was similar in APP/PS1 mice fed with a chow diet, NAFLD in APP/PS1 mice reveals cerebral hypoperfusion and furthered cognitive decline. NAFLD reduced plasma beta40- and beta42-amyloid levels and altered hepatic but not brain expression of genes involved in beta-amyloid peptide production and clearance. Altogether, our results suggest that in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) diet-induced NAFLD contributes to the development and progression of brain abnormalities through unbalanced brain MUFAs and PUFAs metabolism and cerebral hypoperfusion, irrespective of brain amyloid pathology that may ultimately contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

Alkyl-Acylglycerols and the Important Clinical Ramifications of Raising Plasmalogens in Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. A critical factor involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is the decline of plasmalogens, a key glycerophospholipid required for normal neuron function. An accumulating body of evidence correlates low blood and brain plasmalogens with higher levels of AD pathology and lower cognition scores and indicates that declines in these phospholipids begin years before clinical symptoms develop. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that high blood plasmalogen levels neutralize the increased risk of dementia in persons who carry the APOE epsilon 4 allele, the most significant genetic risk factor for AD. There are over 30 common species of plasmalogens in the human body with different plasmalogen species playing different roles, depending on the organ and cell type. Accordingly, there is great interest in understanding how to selectively target plasmalogen augmentation for specific health needs. For example, brain white matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas gray matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fortunately, the structure-activity and biochemistry of plasmalogen augmentation has been extensively studied in cell and animal models. Restoring and augmenting levels of selective plasmalogens can be achieved with dietary supplementation of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils containing the desired fatty acid type at the 2-acyl position. Neuron-targeted 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol containing DHA has been shown to be neuroprotective and neuroactive in animal models of neurodegeneration. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which plasmalogen deficiency leads to Alzheimer's and/or dementia and the critical role that 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils can play in patients with those disorders.

Association of Cortical beta-Amyloid with Erythrocyte Membrane Monounsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia. We examined the relationships between erythrocyte membrane monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) load in older adults reporting subjective memory complaints. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT); a randomised controlled trial. French community dwellers aged 70 or over reporting subjective memory complaints, but free from a diagnosis of clinical dementia. Participants of this study were 61 individuals from the placebo arm of the MAPT trial with data on erythrocyte membrane fatty acid levels and cortical Abeta load. Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte cell membranes using gas chromatography. Associations between erythrocyte membrane MUFAs and SFAs and cortical Abeta load were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p <= 0.005 (10 comparisons) after correction for multiple testing. We found no significant associations between fatty acids and cortical Abeta load using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, cognition, PET-scan to clinical assessment interval, PET-scan to blood collection interval and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. The association closest to significance was that between erythrocyte membrane stearic acid and Abeta (B-coefficient 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00,0.05, p = 0.05). This association, although statistically non-significant, appeared to be stronger amongst ApoE epsilon4 carriers (B-coefficient 0.04, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.09, p = 0.08) compared to ApoE epsilon4 non-carriers (B-coefficient 0.02, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.05, p = 0.18) in age and sex stratified analysis. Future research in the form of large longitudinal observational study is needed to validate our findings, particularly regarding the potential association of stearic acid with cortical Abeta.

Dietary fatty acids and predementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Furthermore, a reduction of risk for cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, and high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data, together with epidemiological evidence, support the idea that n-3 PUFA may play a role in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning in predementia syndromes, but not when the AD process has already taken over. Therefore, at present, no definitive dietary recommendations on fish and unsaturated fatty acids consumption, or lower intake of saturated fat, in relation to the risk for dementia and cognitive decline are possible.

Dietary fat composition and dementia risk. This is a qualitative review of the evidence linking dietary fat composition to the risk of developing dementia. The review considers laboratory and animal studies that identify underlying mechanisms as well as prospective epidemiologic studies linking biochemical or dietary fatty acids to cognitive decline or incident dementia. Several lines of evidence provide support for the hypothesis that high saturated or trans fatty acids increase the risk of dementia and high polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decrease risk. Dietary fat composition is an important factor in blood-brain barrier function and the blood cholesterol profile. Cholesterol and blood-brain barrier function are involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, and the primary genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, apolipoprotein E-epsilon4, is involved in cholesterol transport. The epidemiologic literature is seemingly inconsistent on this topic, but many studies are difficult to interpret because of analytical techniques that ignored negative confounding by other fatty acids, which likely resulted in null findings. The studies that appropriately adjust for confounding by other fats support the dietary fat composition hypothesis.

Chronic consumption of trans-fat-rich diet increases hepatic cholesterol levels and impairs muscle insulin sensitivity without leading to hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia in female Fischer rats. The impact of industrial trans fatty acids (TFAs) on lipid metabolism and health remains elusive. We compared the effect of long-term (52 weeks) ingestion of 10% partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, providing 4.2% of total energy from TFAs, on hepatic lipid metabolism and muscle insulin sensitivity in weanling female Fischer rats with that of palmolein (monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA), sunflower (n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, PUFA), and a blend of sunflower and fish oil (n-3 PUFA). The proportion of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in total cholesterol and reverse cholesterol transport-associated protein expressions were similar in all the groups. Despite higher lipogenic-pathway protein levels, steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia was not observed in TFA-fed rats. Though TFA ingestion had no effect on fasting plasma glucose, insulin levels or oral glucose tolerance, it significantly decreased muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as compared to PUFAs. Further, TFA ingestion increased adipose tissue retinol-binding protein 4 mRNA as compared to PUFAs (n-6 or n-3). The effects of MUFA (oleic acid) on all these parameters were comparable to those observed for TFAs. Compared to PUFA-rich diets, chronic consumption of a TFA-rich diet did not lead to steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia; however, it significantly impaired muscle insulin sensitivity, while no changes were found in the oral glucose tolerance test.

Differential Deleterious Impact of Highly Saturated Versus Monounsaturated Fat Intake on Vascular Function, Structure, and Mechanics in Mice. Vegetable oils such as palm oil (enriched in saturated fatty acids, SFA) and high-oleic-acid sunflower oil (HOSO, containing mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFA) have emerged as the most common replacements for trans-fats in the food industry. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of SFA and MUFA-enriched high-fat (HF) diets on endothelial function, vascular remodeling, and arterial stiffness compared to commercial HF diets. Five-week-old male C57BL6J mice were fed a standard (SD), a HF diet enriched with SFA (saturated oil-enriched Food, SOLF), a HF diet enriched with MUFA (unsaturated oil-enriched Food, UOLF), or a commercial HF diet for 8 weeks. Vascular function was analyzed in the thoracic aorta. Structural and mechanical parameters were assessed in mesenteric arteries by pressure myography. SOLF, UOLF, and HF diet reduced contractile responses to phenylephrine and induced endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aorta. A significant increase in the beta-index, and thus in arterial stiffness, was also detected in mesenteric arteries from the three HF groups, due to enhanced deposition of collagen in the vascular wall. SOLF also induced hypotrophic inward remodeling. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a deleterious effect of HF feeding on obesity-related vascular alterations that is exacerbated by SFA.

Dietary patterns are associated with improved ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study of the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Growing evidence suggests that adherence to certain dietary patterns is associated with improved fecundity and reproductive outcomes in the general population and infertile couples assisted reproductive treatments.  The objective of this study was to assess if dietary patterns are associated with ovarian reserve in reproductive age women without a history of infertility.  This was a cross-sectional study of 185 women in the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Women aged 18-44 without a history of infertility were recruited from the local community at an academic medical center.  Subjects completed validated food frequency and physical activity questionnaires to assess patterns over the year prior to presentation.  Dietary patterns including a Western (including meat, refined carbohydrates, high-calorie drinks), prudent (including fruits, vegetables, olive oil and nuts), fertility (lower intake of trans fat with higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, increased intake of plant based protein, high-fat dairy, lower glycemic load carbohydrates and supplemental iron) and profertility diet (PFD) (characterize by whole grains, soy and seafood, low pesticide residue produce, supplemental folic acid, B12 and vitamin D) were identified through principal component analysis.  Main outcome measures were serum antimullerian hormone concentration (AMH) (ng/mL) and antral follicle count (AFC) obtained by transvaginal ultrasound.  After stratifying by BMI, adjusting for age, smoking and physical activity, dietary patterns were not associated with ovarian reserve in normal weight women.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet in overweight and obese women (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) was associated with a significantly higher AMH.  Women in the third and fourth quartiles of PFD adherence had a mean AMH concentration of 1.45 ng/mL (95%CI 0.33-2.56, p = 0.01) and 1.67 ng/mL (95%CI 0.60-2.74, p = 0.003) higher than women in the lowest quartile respectively.  The highest adherence to PFD was also associated with a higher AFC in women with a BMI >= 25 kg/m2 (beta = 7.8, 95%CI 0.003-15.34, p < 0.05).  Other common dietary patterns were not significantly associated with ovarian reserve.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet is associated with improved markers of ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women.  These findings provide novel insight on potential modifiable lifestyle factors associated with ovarian reserve. 

Effects of trans fatty acids on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Previous work had shown that dietary trans fatty acids (tFA) resulted in decreased fat deposition in adipose tissue. This study was conducted to see if tFA influence lipid accumulation in Swiss mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, which are widely used as an adipocyte model. Cells were cultured in the presence of experimental or control growth media supplemented with fatty acids complexed to bovine serum albumin. Fatty acid compositions of experimental and control growth media were similar except that the octadecenoates in the control growth media were cis fatty acids, whereas those in the experimental media contained both cis and trans fatty acids. Cell-conditioned media and cellular lipids at the preadipocyte and differentiating adipocyte stages were analyzed. At both stages of development, less fat accumulated in cells cultured in the presence of tFA, due primarily to a decrease in the nonpolar lipid content of cells exposed to tFA, and linoleate to arachidonate ratios were higher in cells supplemented with tFA. Calculations comparing sums of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cells at the differentiating adipocyte stage suggested that tFA may have replaced monounsaturated fatty acids in the nonpolar lipid fraction and saturated fatty acids in the polar lipid fraction. The results of these studies are in good agreement with the in vivo effects of tFA seen in previous work with mouse adipose tissue. It was concluded that the 3T3-L1 in vitro model is an appropriate system for further studies of tFA and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.

Determination of antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids, and fatty acid composition of rapeseed varieties. Three different analytical methods: ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were used for determination of antioxidant capacity of seven rapeseed varieties. Antioxidant capacity and levels of the total phenolic content, individual phenolic acids, fatty acid composition, and the selected physicochemical properties of the studied rapeseed cultivars were determined. Mean ORAC values for methanolic extracts of rapeseeds (4092-12989 mmol of Trolox/100 g) were significantly higher than FRAP and DPPH values (6218-7641 and 6238-7645 mumol of Trolox/100 g, respectively). Although FRAP and DPPH results were lower than ORAC values for all studied rapeseed varieties, there are linear and significant correlations between these three analytical methods (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.9124 and 0.9930, p < 0.005). Also, total phenolic compounds in rapeseeds correlated with antioxidant capacity (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.8708 and 0.9516, p < 0.01). Total phenolic acids determined by HPLC varied from 20.3 mg to 40.7 mg per 100 g of rapeseed flour, and the main phenolic acid is sinapic acid (17.4-36.4 mg/100 g). Fatty acid composition (SAFA = 7.2-8.6%, MUFA = 58.5-68.0%, PUFA = 24.7-33.9%) and the absence of trans-fatty acids indicate that the studied rapeseed varieties can be a source of unsaturated fatty acids and have a positive impact on human health.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

Determination of trans-fatty acids in food samples based on the precolumn fluorescence derivatization by high performance liquid chromatography.  Trans-fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids that are considered to have health risks.  1,3,5,7-Tetramethyl-8-butyrethylenediamine-difluoroboradiaza-s-indacene is a highly sensitive fluorescent labeling reagent for carboxylic acids developed by our lab.  In this study, using this precolumn fluorescent derivatization reagent, a rapid and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method was developed for the determination of two trans-fatty acids in food samples.  Under the optimized derivative conditions, two trans-fatty acids were tagged with the fluorescent labeling reagent in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide at 25 degrees C for 30 min.  Then, the baseline separation of trans- and cis-fatty acids and their saturated fatty acid with similar structures was achieved with less interference using a reversed-phased C18 column with isocratic elution in 14 min.  With fluorescence detection at lambdaex /lambdaem  = 490 /510 nm, the linear range of the TFAs was 1.0-200 nM with low detection limits in the range of 0.1-0.2 nM (signal-to-noise ratio = 3).  In addition, the proposed approach was successfully applied for the detection of trans-fatty acids in food samples, and the recoveries using this method ranged from 96.02 to 109.22% with low relative standard deviations of 1.2-4.3% (n = 6).

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the metabolism of fatty acids, including monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. An imbalance in these fatty acids has been linked to cognitive decline and AD (Abstract 1).
2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD is associated with cognitive decline and AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD, which in turn affects brain perfusion, inflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately leading to AD (Abstract 1).
3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that play a crucial role in neuronal function. Low plasmalogen levels have been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence plasmalogen metabolism, leading to decreased plasmalogen levels and increased AD risk (Abstract 2).
4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism of dietary fatty acids, including saturated (SFAs), MUFAs, and PUFAs. An imbalance in these fatty acids has been linked to cognitive decline and AD (Abstracts 3-6).
5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known risk factors for AD. This could be mediated through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, NAFLD, or other mechanisms (Abstracts 1, 7, and 8).
6. **Gut-Brain Axis**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the gut-brain axis, which is involved in the regulation of metabolic responses, including those related to fatty acid metabolism. Alterations in the gut-brain axis have been linked to AD (Abstract 9).
7. **Trans-Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the metabolism of trans-fatty acids, which have been linked to increased AD risk. This could be mediated through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism or other mechanisms (Abstracts 10-12).

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, NAFLD, plasmalogen levels, dietary fatty acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, the gut-brain axis, and trans-fatty acids. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and intermediate entities involved in this relationship.

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and the Underlying Altered Fatty Acid Metabolism, Reveals Brain Hypoperfusion and Contributes to the Cognitive Decline in APP/PS1 Mice. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of chronic liver disease, is associated with cognitive decline in middle-aged adults, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. We hypothesized that NAFLD would unveil the appearance of brain hypoperfusion in association with altered plasma and brain lipid metabolism. To test our hypothesis, amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat, cholesterol and cholate diet, inducing NAFLD without obesity and hyperglycemia. The diet-induced NAFLD disturbed monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid (MUFAs, PUFAs) metabolism in the plasma, liver, and brain, and particularly reduced n-3 PUFAs levels. These alterations in lipid homeostasis were associated in the brain with an increased expression of Tnfalpha, Cox2, p21, and Nox2, reminiscent of brain inflammation, senescence, and oxidative stress. In addition, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, while brain perfusion was similar in APP/PS1 mice fed with a chow diet, NAFLD in APP/PS1 mice reveals cerebral hypoperfusion and furthered cognitive decline. NAFLD reduced plasma beta40- and beta42-amyloid levels and altered hepatic but not brain expression of genes involved in beta-amyloid peptide production and clearance. Altogether, our results suggest that in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) diet-induced NAFLD contributes to the development and progression of brain abnormalities through unbalanced brain MUFAs and PUFAs metabolism and cerebral hypoperfusion, irrespective of brain amyloid pathology that may ultimately contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

Alkyl-Acylglycerols and the Important Clinical Ramifications of Raising Plasmalogens in Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. A critical factor involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is the decline of plasmalogens, a key glycerophospholipid required for normal neuron function. An accumulating body of evidence correlates low blood and brain plasmalogens with higher levels of AD pathology and lower cognition scores and indicates that declines in these phospholipids begin years before clinical symptoms develop. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that high blood plasmalogen levels neutralize the increased risk of dementia in persons who carry the APOE epsilon 4 allele, the most significant genetic risk factor for AD. There are over 30 common species of plasmalogens in the human body with different plasmalogen species playing different roles, depending on the organ and cell type. Accordingly, there is great interest in understanding how to selectively target plasmalogen augmentation for specific health needs. For example, brain white matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas gray matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fortunately, the structure-activity and biochemistry of plasmalogen augmentation has been extensively studied in cell and animal models. Restoring and augmenting levels of selective plasmalogens can be achieved with dietary supplementation of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils containing the desired fatty acid type at the 2-acyl position. Neuron-targeted 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol containing DHA has been shown to be neuroprotective and neuroactive in animal models of neurodegeneration. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which plasmalogen deficiency leads to Alzheimer's and/or dementia and the critical role that 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils can play in patients with those disorders.

Association of Cortical beta-Amyloid with Erythrocyte Membrane Monounsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia. We examined the relationships between erythrocyte membrane monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) load in older adults reporting subjective memory complaints. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT); a randomised controlled trial. French community dwellers aged 70 or over reporting subjective memory complaints, but free from a diagnosis of clinical dementia. Participants of this study were 61 individuals from the placebo arm of the MAPT trial with data on erythrocyte membrane fatty acid levels and cortical Abeta load. Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte cell membranes using gas chromatography. Associations between erythrocyte membrane MUFAs and SFAs and cortical Abeta load were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p <= 0.005 (10 comparisons) after correction for multiple testing. We found no significant associations between fatty acids and cortical Abeta load using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, cognition, PET-scan to clinical assessment interval, PET-scan to blood collection interval and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. The association closest to significance was that between erythrocyte membrane stearic acid and Abeta (B-coefficient 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00,0.05, p = 0.05). This association, although statistically non-significant, appeared to be stronger amongst ApoE epsilon4 carriers (B-coefficient 0.04, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.09, p = 0.08) compared to ApoE epsilon4 non-carriers (B-coefficient 0.02, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.05, p = 0.18) in age and sex stratified analysis. Future research in the form of large longitudinal observational study is needed to validate our findings, particularly regarding the potential association of stearic acid with cortical Abeta.

Dietary fatty acids and predementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Furthermore, a reduction of risk for cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, and high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data, together with epidemiological evidence, support the idea that n-3 PUFA may play a role in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning in predementia syndromes, but not when the AD process has already taken over. Therefore, at present, no definitive dietary recommendations on fish and unsaturated fatty acids consumption, or lower intake of saturated fat, in relation to the risk for dementia and cognitive decline are possible.

Dietary fat composition and dementia risk. This is a qualitative review of the evidence linking dietary fat composition to the risk of developing dementia. The review considers laboratory and animal studies that identify underlying mechanisms as well as prospective epidemiologic studies linking biochemical or dietary fatty acids to cognitive decline or incident dementia. Several lines of evidence provide support for the hypothesis that high saturated or trans fatty acids increase the risk of dementia and high polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decrease risk. Dietary fat composition is an important factor in blood-brain barrier function and the blood cholesterol profile. Cholesterol and blood-brain barrier function are involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, and the primary genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, apolipoprotein E-epsilon4, is involved in cholesterol transport. The epidemiologic literature is seemingly inconsistent on this topic, but many studies are difficult to interpret because of analytical techniques that ignored negative confounding by other fatty acids, which likely resulted in null findings. The studies that appropriately adjust for confounding by other fats support the dietary fat composition hypothesis.

Chronic consumption of trans-fat-rich diet increases hepatic cholesterol levels and impairs muscle insulin sensitivity without leading to hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia in female Fischer rats. The impact of industrial trans fatty acids (TFAs) on lipid metabolism and health remains elusive. We compared the effect of long-term (52 weeks) ingestion of 10% partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, providing 4.2% of total energy from TFAs, on hepatic lipid metabolism and muscle insulin sensitivity in weanling female Fischer rats with that of palmolein (monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA), sunflower (n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, PUFA), and a blend of sunflower and fish oil (n-3 PUFA). The proportion of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in total cholesterol and reverse cholesterol transport-associated protein expressions were similar in all the groups. Despite higher lipogenic-pathway protein levels, steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia was not observed in TFA-fed rats. Though TFA ingestion had no effect on fasting plasma glucose, insulin levels or oral glucose tolerance, it significantly decreased muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as compared to PUFAs. Further, TFA ingestion increased adipose tissue retinol-binding protein 4 mRNA as compared to PUFAs (n-6 or n-3). The effects of MUFA (oleic acid) on all these parameters were comparable to those observed for TFAs. Compared to PUFA-rich diets, chronic consumption of a TFA-rich diet did not lead to steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia; however, it significantly impaired muscle insulin sensitivity, while no changes were found in the oral glucose tolerance test.

Differential Deleterious Impact of Highly Saturated Versus Monounsaturated Fat Intake on Vascular Function, Structure, and Mechanics in Mice. Vegetable oils such as palm oil (enriched in saturated fatty acids, SFA) and high-oleic-acid sunflower oil (HOSO, containing mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFA) have emerged as the most common replacements for trans-fats in the food industry. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of SFA and MUFA-enriched high-fat (HF) diets on endothelial function, vascular remodeling, and arterial stiffness compared to commercial HF diets. Five-week-old male C57BL6J mice were fed a standard (SD), a HF diet enriched with SFA (saturated oil-enriched Food, SOLF), a HF diet enriched with MUFA (unsaturated oil-enriched Food, UOLF), or a commercial HF diet for 8 weeks. Vascular function was analyzed in the thoracic aorta. Structural and mechanical parameters were assessed in mesenteric arteries by pressure myography. SOLF, UOLF, and HF diet reduced contractile responses to phenylephrine and induced endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aorta. A significant increase in the beta-index, and thus in arterial stiffness, was also detected in mesenteric arteries from the three HF groups, due to enhanced deposition of collagen in the vascular wall. SOLF also induced hypotrophic inward remodeling. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a deleterious effect of HF feeding on obesity-related vascular alterations that is exacerbated by SFA.

Dietary patterns are associated with improved ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study of the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Growing evidence suggests that adherence to certain dietary patterns is associated with improved fecundity and reproductive outcomes in the general population and infertile couples assisted reproductive treatments.  The objective of this study was to assess if dietary patterns are associated with ovarian reserve in reproductive age women without a history of infertility.  This was a cross-sectional study of 185 women in the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Women aged 18-44 without a history of infertility were recruited from the local community at an academic medical center.  Subjects completed validated food frequency and physical activity questionnaires to assess patterns over the year prior to presentation.  Dietary patterns including a Western (including meat, refined carbohydrates, high-calorie drinks), prudent (including fruits, vegetables, olive oil and nuts), fertility (lower intake of trans fat with higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, increased intake of plant based protein, high-fat dairy, lower glycemic load carbohydrates and supplemental iron) and profertility diet (PFD) (characterize by whole grains, soy and seafood, low pesticide residue produce, supplemental folic acid, B12 and vitamin D) were identified through principal component analysis.  Main outcome measures were serum antimullerian hormone concentration (AMH) (ng/mL) and antral follicle count (AFC) obtained by transvaginal ultrasound.  After stratifying by BMI, adjusting for age, smoking and physical activity, dietary patterns were not associated with ovarian reserve in normal weight women.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet in overweight and obese women (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) was associated with a significantly higher AMH.  Women in the third and fourth quartiles of PFD adherence had a mean AMH concentration of 1.45 ng/mL (95%CI 0.33-2.56, p = 0.01) and 1.67 ng/mL (95%CI 0.60-2.74, p = 0.003) higher than women in the lowest quartile respectively.  The highest adherence to PFD was also associated with a higher AFC in women with a BMI >= 25 kg/m2 (beta = 7.8, 95%CI 0.003-15.34, p < 0.05).  Other common dietary patterns were not significantly associated with ovarian reserve.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet is associated with improved markers of ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women.  These findings provide novel insight on potential modifiable lifestyle factors associated with ovarian reserve. 

Effects of trans fatty acids on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Previous work had shown that dietary trans fatty acids (tFA) resulted in decreased fat deposition in adipose tissue. This study was conducted to see if tFA influence lipid accumulation in Swiss mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, which are widely used as an adipocyte model. Cells were cultured in the presence of experimental or control growth media supplemented with fatty acids complexed to bovine serum albumin. Fatty acid compositions of experimental and control growth media were similar except that the octadecenoates in the control growth media were cis fatty acids, whereas those in the experimental media contained both cis and trans fatty acids. Cell-conditioned media and cellular lipids at the preadipocyte and differentiating adipocyte stages were analyzed. At both stages of development, less fat accumulated in cells cultured in the presence of tFA, due primarily to a decrease in the nonpolar lipid content of cells exposed to tFA, and linoleate to arachidonate ratios were higher in cells supplemented with tFA. Calculations comparing sums of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cells at the differentiating adipocyte stage suggested that tFA may have replaced monounsaturated fatty acids in the nonpolar lipid fraction and saturated fatty acids in the polar lipid fraction. The results of these studies are in good agreement with the in vivo effects of tFA seen in previous work with mouse adipose tissue. It was concluded that the 3T3-L1 in vitro model is an appropriate system for further studies of tFA and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.

Determination of antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids, and fatty acid composition of rapeseed varieties. Three different analytical methods: ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were used for determination of antioxidant capacity of seven rapeseed varieties. Antioxidant capacity and levels of the total phenolic content, individual phenolic acids, fatty acid composition, and the selected physicochemical properties of the studied rapeseed cultivars were determined. Mean ORAC values for methanolic extracts of rapeseeds (4092-12989 mmol of Trolox/100 g) were significantly higher than FRAP and DPPH values (6218-7641 and 6238-7645 mumol of Trolox/100 g, respectively). Although FRAP and DPPH results were lower than ORAC values for all studied rapeseed varieties, there are linear and significant correlations between these three analytical methods (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.9124 and 0.9930, p < 0.005). Also, total phenolic compounds in rapeseeds correlated with antioxidant capacity (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.8708 and 0.9516, p < 0.01). Total phenolic acids determined by HPLC varied from 20.3 mg to 40.7 mg per 100 g of rapeseed flour, and the main phenolic acid is sinapic acid (17.4-36.4 mg/100 g). Fatty acid composition (SAFA = 7.2-8.6%, MUFA = 58.5-68.0%, PUFA = 24.7-33.9%) and the absence of trans-fatty acids indicate that the studied rapeseed varieties can be a source of unsaturated fatty acids and have a positive impact on human health.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

Content of industrially produced trans fatty acids in breast milk: An observational study.  Breast milk may contain industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs), which can affect the content of essential fatty acids (EFAs).  This could have significant implications for the child's development.  The fatty acids present in breast milk can be modified by adjusting the mother's diet.  The objective of this study was to determine the content of industrially produced TFAs present in colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk produced by mothers between 18 and 45 years of age in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, based on a longitudinal observational study.  The TFA content in the breast milk of 33 lactating women was analyzed using gas chromatography.  The mothers' consumption of TFAs was also estimated by analyzing a log prepared through 24-hr dietary recall (24HR) obtained in each period.  The TFA content in the mothers' diet was similar across the colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk phases: 1.64 +/- 1.25 g, 1.39 +/- 1.01, and 1.66 +/- 1.13 g, respectively.  The total TFA content was 1.529% +/- 1.648% for colostrum; 0.748% +/- 1.033% for transitional milk and 0.945% +/- 1.368% for mature milk.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the metabolism of fatty acids, including monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. These fatty acids play a crucial role in maintaining brain health and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.

2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD has been linked to cognitive decline and AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to brain hypoperfusion, inflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that are essential for normal neuron function. Low levels of plasmalogens have been associated with AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence plasmalogen levels by regulating the metabolism of fatty acids, which are necessary for plasmalogen synthesis.

4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect an individual's response to dietary fatty acids, including saturated (SFAs), MUFAs, and PUFAs. A diet high in SFAs and low in MUFAs and PUFAs has been linked to an increased risk of AD. The F3 wt Allele might modulate the effects of dietary fatty acids on AD risk by influencing fatty acid metabolism and plasmalogen levels.

5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are key features of AD. Altered fatty acid metabolism and low plasmalogen levels might lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

6. **Gut-Brain Axis**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the gut-brain axis, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health. An imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, has been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to dysbiosis by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to changes in the gut-brain axis and increase the risk of AD.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, which in turn influences NAFLD, plasmalogen levels, dietary fatty acid responses, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the gut-brain axis. These intermediate entities and processes might contribute to the development and progression of AD in individuals with the F3 wt Allele. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and the Underlying Altered Fatty Acid Metabolism, Reveals Brain Hypoperfusion and Contributes to the Cognitive Decline in APP/PS1 Mice. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of chronic liver disease, is associated with cognitive decline in middle-aged adults, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. We hypothesized that NAFLD would unveil the appearance of brain hypoperfusion in association with altered plasma and brain lipid metabolism. To test our hypothesis, amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat, cholesterol and cholate diet, inducing NAFLD without obesity and hyperglycemia. The diet-induced NAFLD disturbed monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid (MUFAs, PUFAs) metabolism in the plasma, liver, and brain, and particularly reduced n-3 PUFAs levels. These alterations in lipid homeostasis were associated in the brain with an increased expression of Tnfalpha, Cox2, p21, and Nox2, reminiscent of brain inflammation, senescence, and oxidative stress. In addition, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, while brain perfusion was similar in APP/PS1 mice fed with a chow diet, NAFLD in APP/PS1 mice reveals cerebral hypoperfusion and furthered cognitive decline. NAFLD reduced plasma beta40- and beta42-amyloid levels and altered hepatic but not brain expression of genes involved in beta-amyloid peptide production and clearance. Altogether, our results suggest that in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) diet-induced NAFLD contributes to the development and progression of brain abnormalities through unbalanced brain MUFAs and PUFAs metabolism and cerebral hypoperfusion, irrespective of brain amyloid pathology that may ultimately contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

Alkyl-Acylglycerols and the Important Clinical Ramifications of Raising Plasmalogens in Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. A critical factor involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is the decline of plasmalogens, a key glycerophospholipid required for normal neuron function. An accumulating body of evidence correlates low blood and brain plasmalogens with higher levels of AD pathology and lower cognition scores and indicates that declines in these phospholipids begin years before clinical symptoms develop. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that high blood plasmalogen levels neutralize the increased risk of dementia in persons who carry the APOE epsilon 4 allele, the most significant genetic risk factor for AD. There are over 30 common species of plasmalogens in the human body with different plasmalogen species playing different roles, depending on the organ and cell type. Accordingly, there is great interest in understanding how to selectively target plasmalogen augmentation for specific health needs. For example, brain white matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas gray matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fortunately, the structure-activity and biochemistry of plasmalogen augmentation has been extensively studied in cell and animal models. Restoring and augmenting levels of selective plasmalogens can be achieved with dietary supplementation of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils containing the desired fatty acid type at the 2-acyl position. Neuron-targeted 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol containing DHA has been shown to be neuroprotective and neuroactive in animal models of neurodegeneration. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which plasmalogen deficiency leads to Alzheimer's and/or dementia and the critical role that 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils can play in patients with those disorders.

Association of Cortical beta-Amyloid with Erythrocyte Membrane Monounsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia. We examined the relationships between erythrocyte membrane monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) load in older adults reporting subjective memory complaints. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT); a randomised controlled trial. French community dwellers aged 70 or over reporting subjective memory complaints, but free from a diagnosis of clinical dementia. Participants of this study were 61 individuals from the placebo arm of the MAPT trial with data on erythrocyte membrane fatty acid levels and cortical Abeta load. Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte cell membranes using gas chromatography. Associations between erythrocyte membrane MUFAs and SFAs and cortical Abeta load were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p <= 0.005 (10 comparisons) after correction for multiple testing. We found no significant associations between fatty acids and cortical Abeta load using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, cognition, PET-scan to clinical assessment interval, PET-scan to blood collection interval and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. The association closest to significance was that between erythrocyte membrane stearic acid and Abeta (B-coefficient 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00,0.05, p = 0.05). This association, although statistically non-significant, appeared to be stronger amongst ApoE epsilon4 carriers (B-coefficient 0.04, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.09, p = 0.08) compared to ApoE epsilon4 non-carriers (B-coefficient 0.02, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.05, p = 0.18) in age and sex stratified analysis. Future research in the form of large longitudinal observational study is needed to validate our findings, particularly regarding the potential association of stearic acid with cortical Abeta.

Dietary fatty acids and predementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Furthermore, a reduction of risk for cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, and high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data, together with epidemiological evidence, support the idea that n-3 PUFA may play a role in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning in predementia syndromes, but not when the AD process has already taken over. Therefore, at present, no definitive dietary recommendations on fish and unsaturated fatty acids consumption, or lower intake of saturated fat, in relation to the risk for dementia and cognitive decline are possible.

Dietary fat composition and dementia risk. This is a qualitative review of the evidence linking dietary fat composition to the risk of developing dementia. The review considers laboratory and animal studies that identify underlying mechanisms as well as prospective epidemiologic studies linking biochemical or dietary fatty acids to cognitive decline or incident dementia. Several lines of evidence provide support for the hypothesis that high saturated or trans fatty acids increase the risk of dementia and high polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decrease risk. Dietary fat composition is an important factor in blood-brain barrier function and the blood cholesterol profile. Cholesterol and blood-brain barrier function are involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, and the primary genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, apolipoprotein E-epsilon4, is involved in cholesterol transport. The epidemiologic literature is seemingly inconsistent on this topic, but many studies are difficult to interpret because of analytical techniques that ignored negative confounding by other fatty acids, which likely resulted in null findings. The studies that appropriately adjust for confounding by other fats support the dietary fat composition hypothesis.

Differential Deleterious Impact of Highly Saturated Versus Monounsaturated Fat Intake on Vascular Function, Structure, and Mechanics in Mice. Vegetable oils such as palm oil (enriched in saturated fatty acids, SFA) and high-oleic-acid sunflower oil (HOSO, containing mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFA) have emerged as the most common replacements for trans-fats in the food industry. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of SFA and MUFA-enriched high-fat (HF) diets on endothelial function, vascular remodeling, and arterial stiffness compared to commercial HF diets. Five-week-old male C57BL6J mice were fed a standard (SD), a HF diet enriched with SFA (saturated oil-enriched Food, SOLF), a HF diet enriched with MUFA (unsaturated oil-enriched Food, UOLF), or a commercial HF diet for 8 weeks. Vascular function was analyzed in the thoracic aorta. Structural and mechanical parameters were assessed in mesenteric arteries by pressure myography. SOLF, UOLF, and HF diet reduced contractile responses to phenylephrine and induced endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aorta. A significant increase in the beta-index, and thus in arterial stiffness, was also detected in mesenteric arteries from the three HF groups, due to enhanced deposition of collagen in the vascular wall. SOLF also induced hypotrophic inward remodeling. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a deleterious effect of HF feeding on obesity-related vascular alterations that is exacerbated by SFA.

Dietary patterns are associated with improved ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study of the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Growing evidence suggests that adherence to certain dietary patterns is associated with improved fecundity and reproductive outcomes in the general population and infertile couples assisted reproductive treatments.  The objective of this study was to assess if dietary patterns are associated with ovarian reserve in reproductive age women without a history of infertility.  This was a cross-sectional study of 185 women in the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Women aged 18-44 without a history of infertility were recruited from the local community at an academic medical center.  Subjects completed validated food frequency and physical activity questionnaires to assess patterns over the year prior to presentation.  Dietary patterns including a Western (including meat, refined carbohydrates, high-calorie drinks), prudent (including fruits, vegetables, olive oil and nuts), fertility (lower intake of trans fat with higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, increased intake of plant based protein, high-fat dairy, lower glycemic load carbohydrates and supplemental iron) and profertility diet (PFD) (characterize by whole grains, soy and seafood, low pesticide residue produce, supplemental folic acid, B12 and vitamin D) were identified through principal component analysis.  Main outcome measures were serum antimullerian hormone concentration (AMH) (ng/mL) and antral follicle count (AFC) obtained by transvaginal ultrasound.  After stratifying by BMI, adjusting for age, smoking and physical activity, dietary patterns were not associated with ovarian reserve in normal weight women.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet in overweight and obese women (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) was associated with a significantly higher AMH.  Women in the third and fourth quartiles of PFD adherence had a mean AMH concentration of 1.45 ng/mL (95%CI 0.33-2.56, p = 0.01) and 1.67 ng/mL (95%CI 0.60-2.74, p = 0.003) higher than women in the lowest quartile respectively.  The highest adherence to PFD was also associated with a higher AFC in women with a BMI >= 25 kg/m2 (beta = 7.8, 95%CI 0.003-15.34, p < 0.05).  Other common dietary patterns were not significantly associated with ovarian reserve.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet is associated with improved markers of ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women.  These findings provide novel insight on potential modifiable lifestyle factors associated with ovarian reserve. 

Effects of trans fatty acids on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Previous work had shown that dietary trans fatty acids (tFA) resulted in decreased fat deposition in adipose tissue. This study was conducted to see if tFA influence lipid accumulation in Swiss mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, which are widely used as an adipocyte model. Cells were cultured in the presence of experimental or control growth media supplemented with fatty acids complexed to bovine serum albumin. Fatty acid compositions of experimental and control growth media were similar except that the octadecenoates in the control growth media were cis fatty acids, whereas those in the experimental media contained both cis and trans fatty acids. Cell-conditioned media and cellular lipids at the preadipocyte and differentiating adipocyte stages were analyzed. At both stages of development, less fat accumulated in cells cultured in the presence of tFA, due primarily to a decrease in the nonpolar lipid content of cells exposed to tFA, and linoleate to arachidonate ratios were higher in cells supplemented with tFA. Calculations comparing sums of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cells at the differentiating adipocyte stage suggested that tFA may have replaced monounsaturated fatty acids in the nonpolar lipid fraction and saturated fatty acids in the polar lipid fraction. The results of these studies are in good agreement with the in vivo effects of tFA seen in previous work with mouse adipose tissue. It was concluded that the 3T3-L1 in vitro model is an appropriate system for further studies of tFA and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.

Determination of antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids, and fatty acid composition of rapeseed varieties. Three different analytical methods: ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were used for determination of antioxidant capacity of seven rapeseed varieties. Antioxidant capacity and levels of the total phenolic content, individual phenolic acids, fatty acid composition, and the selected physicochemical properties of the studied rapeseed cultivars were determined. Mean ORAC values for methanolic extracts of rapeseeds (4092-12989 mmol of Trolox/100 g) were significantly higher than FRAP and DPPH values (6218-7641 and 6238-7645 mumol of Trolox/100 g, respectively). Although FRAP and DPPH results were lower than ORAC values for all studied rapeseed varieties, there are linear and significant correlations between these three analytical methods (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.9124 and 0.9930, p < 0.005). Also, total phenolic compounds in rapeseeds correlated with antioxidant capacity (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.8708 and 0.9516, p < 0.01). Total phenolic acids determined by HPLC varied from 20.3 mg to 40.7 mg per 100 g of rapeseed flour, and the main phenolic acid is sinapic acid (17.4-36.4 mg/100 g). Fatty acid composition (SAFA = 7.2-8.6%, MUFA = 58.5-68.0%, PUFA = 24.7-33.9%) and the absence of trans-fatty acids indicate that the studied rapeseed varieties can be a source of unsaturated fatty acids and have a positive impact on human health.

How canola and sunflower oils affect lipid profile and anthropometric parameters of participants with dyslipidemia. Background: Restricted intakes of saturated and trans-fatty acids and replacement with poly or monounsaturated fatty acids are emphasized in healthy diets. This study evaluates the effects of a six-month consumption of canola oil compared to sunflower oil on lipid profile and anthropometric parameters of people affected by dyslipidemia. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 96 patients with dyslipidemia, who were randomly assigned into canola oil or the sunflower oil groups. The participants were instructed to record the contents of their daily meals, beverages, fruits, and snacks a day before treatment, at the second clinic visit, in the third month, and at the end of study (i.e., six months). Lipid profile and anthropometric parameters were compared between the two groups. Student t-test or Mann Whitney U test was used for statistical comparisons of variables between groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust the confounding factor effects. Results: Of the enrolled participants, 44 (45.8%) were on sunflower oil diet and 52 (54.2%) on canola oil diet. We observed no change in anthropometric parameters and thus no significant difference between the two groups (p>0.05). Significant reductions in LDL-C (p<0.001), total cholesterol (p<0.001) and triglyceride levels (p<0.001), and significant elevation in HDL-C (p=0.008) were observed in canola oil group, as well as those who used sunflower oil. Conclusion: Dietary fats in the form of canola oil or sunflower oil effectively lower the serum cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations. They also result in an increase in serum concentration of HDL-C. These oils, however, did not modify general anthropometric parameters.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

Content of industrially produced trans fatty acids in breast milk: An observational study.  Breast milk may contain industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs), which can affect the content of essential fatty acids (EFAs).  This could have significant implications for the child's development.  The fatty acids present in breast milk can be modified by adjusting the mother's diet.  The objective of this study was to determine the content of industrially produced TFAs present in colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk produced by mothers between 18 and 45 years of age in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, based on a longitudinal observational study.  The TFA content in the breast milk of 33 lactating women was analyzed using gas chromatography.  The mothers' consumption of TFAs was also estimated by analyzing a log prepared through 24-hr dietary recall (24HR) obtained in each period.  The TFA content in the mothers' diet was similar across the colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk phases: 1.64 +/- 1.25 g, 1.39 +/- 1.01, and 1.66 +/- 1.13 g, respectively.  The total TFA content was 1.529% +/- 1.648% for colostrum; 0.748% +/- 1.033% for transitional milk and 0.945% +/- 1.368% for mature milk.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the metabolism of fatty acids, including monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. These fatty acids play a crucial role in maintaining brain health and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.

2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD has been linked to cognitive decline and AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to brain hypoperfusion, inflammation, and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that are essential for normal neuron function. Low levels of plasmalogens have been associated with AD. The F3 wt Allele might influence plasmalogen levels by regulating the metabolism of fatty acids, which are necessary for plasmalogen synthesis.

4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might affect an individual's response to dietary fatty acids, including saturated (SFAs), MUFAs, and PUFAs. A diet high in SFAs and low in MUFAs and PUFAs has been linked to an increased risk of AD. The F3 wt Allele might modulate the effects of dietary fatty acids on AD risk by influencing fatty acid metabolism and plasmalogen levels.

5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are key features of AD. Altered fatty acid metabolism and low plasmalogen levels might lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately increasing the risk of AD.

6. **Gut-Brain Axis**: The F3 wt Allele might influence the gut-brain axis, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health. An imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, has been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to dysbiosis by altering fatty acid metabolism, which in turn could lead to changes in the gut-brain axis and increase the risk of AD.

In summary, the F3 wt Allele might be indirectly related to AD through its effects on fatty acid metabolism, NAFLD, plasmalogen levels, dietary fatty acids, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the gut-brain axis. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and the Underlying Altered Fatty Acid Metabolism, Reveals Brain Hypoperfusion and Contributes to the Cognitive Decline in APP/PS1 Mice. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of chronic liver disease, is associated with cognitive decline in middle-aged adults, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. We hypothesized that NAFLD would unveil the appearance of brain hypoperfusion in association with altered plasma and brain lipid metabolism. To test our hypothesis, amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat, cholesterol and cholate diet, inducing NAFLD without obesity and hyperglycemia. The diet-induced NAFLD disturbed monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid (MUFAs, PUFAs) metabolism in the plasma, liver, and brain, and particularly reduced n-3 PUFAs levels. These alterations in lipid homeostasis were associated in the brain with an increased expression of Tnfalpha, Cox2, p21, and Nox2, reminiscent of brain inflammation, senescence, and oxidative stress. In addition, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, while brain perfusion was similar in APP/PS1 mice fed with a chow diet, NAFLD in APP/PS1 mice reveals cerebral hypoperfusion and furthered cognitive decline. NAFLD reduced plasma beta40- and beta42-amyloid levels and altered hepatic but not brain expression of genes involved in beta-amyloid peptide production and clearance. Altogether, our results suggest that in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) diet-induced NAFLD contributes to the development and progression of brain abnormalities through unbalanced brain MUFAs and PUFAs metabolism and cerebral hypoperfusion, irrespective of brain amyloid pathology that may ultimately contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

Alkyl-Acylglycerols and the Important Clinical Ramifications of Raising Plasmalogens in Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. A critical factor involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is the decline of plasmalogens, a key glycerophospholipid required for normal neuron function. An accumulating body of evidence correlates low blood and brain plasmalogens with higher levels of AD pathology and lower cognition scores and indicates that declines in these phospholipids begin years before clinical symptoms develop. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that high blood plasmalogen levels neutralize the increased risk of dementia in persons who carry the APOE epsilon 4 allele, the most significant genetic risk factor for AD. There are over 30 common species of plasmalogens in the human body with different plasmalogen species playing different roles, depending on the organ and cell type. Accordingly, there is great interest in understanding how to selectively target plasmalogen augmentation for specific health needs. For example, brain white matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas gray matter is comprised of plasmalogens containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fortunately, the structure-activity and biochemistry of plasmalogen augmentation has been extensively studied in cell and animal models. Restoring and augmenting levels of selective plasmalogens can be achieved with dietary supplementation of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils containing the desired fatty acid type at the 2-acyl position. Neuron-targeted 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol containing DHA has been shown to be neuroprotective and neuroactive in animal models of neurodegeneration. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which plasmalogen deficiency leads to Alzheimer's and/or dementia and the critical role that 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerol oils can play in patients with those disorders.

Association of Cortical beta-Amyloid with Erythrocyte Membrane Monounsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia. We examined the relationships between erythrocyte membrane monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) load in older adults reporting subjective memory complaints. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT); a randomised controlled trial. French community dwellers aged 70 or over reporting subjective memory complaints, but free from a diagnosis of clinical dementia. Participants of this study were 61 individuals from the placebo arm of the MAPT trial with data on erythrocyte membrane fatty acid levels and cortical Abeta load. Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte cell membranes using gas chromatography. Associations between erythrocyte membrane MUFAs and SFAs and cortical Abeta load were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p <= 0.005 (10 comparisons) after correction for multiple testing. We found no significant associations between fatty acids and cortical Abeta load using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, cognition, PET-scan to clinical assessment interval, PET-scan to blood collection interval and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. The association closest to significance was that between erythrocyte membrane stearic acid and Abeta (B-coefficient 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00,0.05, p = 0.05). This association, although statistically non-significant, appeared to be stronger amongst ApoE epsilon4 carriers (B-coefficient 0.04, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.09, p = 0.08) compared to ApoE epsilon4 non-carriers (B-coefficient 0.02, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.05, p = 0.18) in age and sex stratified analysis. Future research in the form of large longitudinal observational study is needed to validate our findings, particularly regarding the potential association of stearic acid with cortical Abeta.

Dietary fatty acids and predementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Furthermore, a reduction of risk for cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, and high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data, together with epidemiological evidence, support the idea that n-3 PUFA may play a role in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning in predementia syndromes, but not when the AD process has already taken over. Therefore, at present, no definitive dietary recommendations on fish and unsaturated fatty acids consumption, or lower intake of saturated fat, in relation to the risk for dementia and cognitive decline are possible.

Dietary fat composition and dementia risk. This is a qualitative review of the evidence linking dietary fat composition to the risk of developing dementia. The review considers laboratory and animal studies that identify underlying mechanisms as well as prospective epidemiologic studies linking biochemical or dietary fatty acids to cognitive decline or incident dementia. Several lines of evidence provide support for the hypothesis that high saturated or trans fatty acids increase the risk of dementia and high polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decrease risk. Dietary fat composition is an important factor in blood-brain barrier function and the blood cholesterol profile. Cholesterol and blood-brain barrier function are involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, and the primary genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, apolipoprotein E-epsilon4, is involved in cholesterol transport. The epidemiologic literature is seemingly inconsistent on this topic, but many studies are difficult to interpret because of analytical techniques that ignored negative confounding by other fatty acids, which likely resulted in null findings. The studies that appropriately adjust for confounding by other fats support the dietary fat composition hypothesis.

Differential Deleterious Impact of Highly Saturated Versus Monounsaturated Fat Intake on Vascular Function, Structure, and Mechanics in Mice. Vegetable oils such as palm oil (enriched in saturated fatty acids, SFA) and high-oleic-acid sunflower oil (HOSO, containing mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFA) have emerged as the most common replacements for trans-fats in the food industry. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of SFA and MUFA-enriched high-fat (HF) diets on endothelial function, vascular remodeling, and arterial stiffness compared to commercial HF diets. Five-week-old male C57BL6J mice were fed a standard (SD), a HF diet enriched with SFA (saturated oil-enriched Food, SOLF), a HF diet enriched with MUFA (unsaturated oil-enriched Food, UOLF), or a commercial HF diet for 8 weeks. Vascular function was analyzed in the thoracic aorta. Structural and mechanical parameters were assessed in mesenteric arteries by pressure myography. SOLF, UOLF, and HF diet reduced contractile responses to phenylephrine and induced endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aorta. A significant increase in the beta-index, and thus in arterial stiffness, was also detected in mesenteric arteries from the three HF groups, due to enhanced deposition of collagen in the vascular wall. SOLF also induced hypotrophic inward remodeling. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a deleterious effect of HF feeding on obesity-related vascular alterations that is exacerbated by SFA.

Dietary patterns are associated with improved ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study of the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Growing evidence suggests that adherence to certain dietary patterns is associated with improved fecundity and reproductive outcomes in the general population and infertile couples assisted reproductive treatments.  The objective of this study was to assess if dietary patterns are associated with ovarian reserve in reproductive age women without a history of infertility.  This was a cross-sectional study of 185 women in the Lifestyle and Ovarian Reserve (LORe) cohort.  Women aged 18-44 without a history of infertility were recruited from the local community at an academic medical center.  Subjects completed validated food frequency and physical activity questionnaires to assess patterns over the year prior to presentation.  Dietary patterns including a Western (including meat, refined carbohydrates, high-calorie drinks), prudent (including fruits, vegetables, olive oil and nuts), fertility (lower intake of trans fat with higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, increased intake of plant based protein, high-fat dairy, lower glycemic load carbohydrates and supplemental iron) and profertility diet (PFD) (characterize by whole grains, soy and seafood, low pesticide residue produce, supplemental folic acid, B12 and vitamin D) were identified through principal component analysis.  Main outcome measures were serum antimullerian hormone concentration (AMH) (ng/mL) and antral follicle count (AFC) obtained by transvaginal ultrasound.  After stratifying by BMI, adjusting for age, smoking and physical activity, dietary patterns were not associated with ovarian reserve in normal weight women.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet in overweight and obese women (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) was associated with a significantly higher AMH.  Women in the third and fourth quartiles of PFD adherence had a mean AMH concentration of 1.45 ng/mL (95%CI 0.33-2.56, p = 0.01) and 1.67 ng/mL (95%CI 0.60-2.74, p = 0.003) higher than women in the lowest quartile respectively.  The highest adherence to PFD was also associated with a higher AFC in women with a BMI >= 25 kg/m2 (beta = 7.8, 95%CI 0.003-15.34, p < 0.05).  Other common dietary patterns were not significantly associated with ovarian reserve.  Increased adherence to a profertility diet is associated with improved markers of ovarian reserve in overweight and obese women.  These findings provide novel insight on potential modifiable lifestyle factors associated with ovarian reserve. 

Effects of trans fatty acids on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Previous work had shown that dietary trans fatty acids (tFA) resulted in decreased fat deposition in adipose tissue. This study was conducted to see if tFA influence lipid accumulation in Swiss mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, which are widely used as an adipocyte model. Cells were cultured in the presence of experimental or control growth media supplemented with fatty acids complexed to bovine serum albumin. Fatty acid compositions of experimental and control growth media were similar except that the octadecenoates in the control growth media were cis fatty acids, whereas those in the experimental media contained both cis and trans fatty acids. Cell-conditioned media and cellular lipids at the preadipocyte and differentiating adipocyte stages were analyzed. At both stages of development, less fat accumulated in cells cultured in the presence of tFA, due primarily to a decrease in the nonpolar lipid content of cells exposed to tFA, and linoleate to arachidonate ratios were higher in cells supplemented with tFA. Calculations comparing sums of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cells at the differentiating adipocyte stage suggested that tFA may have replaced monounsaturated fatty acids in the nonpolar lipid fraction and saturated fatty acids in the polar lipid fraction. The results of these studies are in good agreement with the in vivo effects of tFA seen in previous work with mouse adipose tissue. It was concluded that the 3T3-L1 in vitro model is an appropriate system for further studies of tFA and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.

Determination of antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids, and fatty acid composition of rapeseed varieties. Three different analytical methods: ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were used for determination of antioxidant capacity of seven rapeseed varieties. Antioxidant capacity and levels of the total phenolic content, individual phenolic acids, fatty acid composition, and the selected physicochemical properties of the studied rapeseed cultivars were determined. Mean ORAC values for methanolic extracts of rapeseeds (4092-12989 mmol of Trolox/100 g) were significantly higher than FRAP and DPPH values (6218-7641 and 6238-7645 mumol of Trolox/100 g, respectively). Although FRAP and DPPH results were lower than ORAC values for all studied rapeseed varieties, there are linear and significant correlations between these three analytical methods (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.9124 and 0.9930, p < 0.005). Also, total phenolic compounds in rapeseeds correlated with antioxidant capacity (correlation coefficients ranged between 0.8708 and 0.9516, p < 0.01). Total phenolic acids determined by HPLC varied from 20.3 mg to 40.7 mg per 100 g of rapeseed flour, and the main phenolic acid is sinapic acid (17.4-36.4 mg/100 g). Fatty acid composition (SAFA = 7.2-8.6%, MUFA = 58.5-68.0%, PUFA = 24.7-33.9%) and the absence of trans-fatty acids indicate that the studied rapeseed varieties can be a source of unsaturated fatty acids and have a positive impact on human health.

Role of diet and nutritional management in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which causes an increased risk of cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. With the worldwide growing incidence of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy dietary pattern, NAFLD has currently been recognized as a major health burden. Dietary patterns and nutrients are the important contributors to the development, progression, and treatment of NAFLD and associated metabolic comorbidities. Generally, hypercaloric diet, especially rich in trans/saturated fat and cholesterol, and fructose-sweetened beverages seem to increase visceral adiposity and stimulate hepatic lipid accumulation and progression into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, whereas reducing caloric intake, increasing soy protein and whey consumption, and supplement of monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics have preventive and therapeutic effects. In addition, choline, fiber, coffee, green tea, and light alcohol drinking might be protective factors for NAFLD. Based on available data, at least 3-5% of weight loss, achieved by hypocaloric diet alone or in conjunction with exercise and behavioral modification, generally reduces hepatic steatosis, and up to 10% weight loss may be needed to improve hepatic necroinflammation. A sustained adherence to diet rather than the actual diet type is a major predictor of successful weight loss. Moreover, a healthy diet has benefits beyond weight reduction on NAFLD patients whether obese or of normal weight. Therefore, nutrition serves as a major route of prevention and treatment of NAFLD, and patients with NAFLD should have an individualized diet recommendation.

Trans Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of 12 Prospective Cohort Studies in the Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCE).  Trans fatty acids (TFAs) have harmful biologic effects that could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but evidence remains uncertain.  We aimed to investigate the prospective associations of TFA biomarkers and T2D by conducting an individual participant-level pooled analysis.  We included data from an international consortium of 12 prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies from six nations.  TFA biomarkers were measured in blood collected between 1990 and 2008 from 25,126 participants aged >=18 years without prevalent diabetes.  Each cohort conducted de novo harmonized analyses using a prespecified protocol, and findings were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.  Heterogeneity was explored by prespecified between-study and within-study characteristics.  During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, 2,843 cases of incident T2D were identified.  In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, no significant associations with T2D were identified for trans/trans-18:2, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94-1.25); cis/trans-18:2, 0.89 (0.73-1.07); and trans/cis-18:2, 0.87 (0.73-1.03).  Trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated with T2D (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.67-0.99], 0.86 [0.75-0.99], and 0.84 [0.74-0.96], respectively).  Findings were not significantly different according to prespecified sources of potential heterogeneity (each P >= 0.1).  Circulating individual trans-18:2 TFA biomarkers were not associated with risk of T2D, while trans-16:1n-9, total trans-18:1, and total trans-18:2 were inversely associated.  Findings may reflect the influence of mixed TFA sources (industrial vs. natural ruminant), a general decline in TFA exposure due to policy changes during this period, or the relatively limited range of TFA levels. 

[Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Toxic Actions of trans-Fatty Acids and Prevention of Related Diseases].  trans-Fatty acids (TFAs), including elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid, are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration.  TFAs are not synthesized in the human body, but are taken into the body from various foods, which are mainly produced during industrial food manufacturing.  Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, allergic diseases, and dementia.  However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TFA-related disorders and the specific molecular targets evoking TFA toxicity are largely unknown.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TFAs cause the cytotoxicity, we focused on cell death and inflammation, which are the main and common pathogenesis of the TFA-related diseases, and analyzed the effects of TFAs on cellular responses to various stimulations inducing cell death and inflammation.  This review provides recent progress in our studies on the molecular mechanisms causing toxic actions of TFAs, which lead to diverse TFA-related disorders. 

Plasma Industrial and Ruminant Trans Fatty Acids and Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the EPIC-Potsdam Cohort.  Although dietary intake of trans fatty acid (TFA) is a major public health concern because of the associated increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, it remains unclear whether TFAs also influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and whether industrial TFAs (iTFAs) and ruminant TFAs (rTFAs) exert the same effect on health.  To investigate the relationship of 7 rTFAs and iTFAs, including 2 conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), plasma phospholipid TFAs were measured in a case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort.  The analytical sample was a random subsample (n = 1,248) and incident cases of T2D (n = 801) over a median follow-up of 6.5 years.  Using multivariable Cox regression models, we examined associations of TFAs with incident T2D.  The TFA subtypes were intercorrelated with each other, with other fatty acids, and with different food sources.  After controlling for other TFAs, the iTFAs (18:1n-6t, 18:1n-9t, 18:2n-6,9t) were not associated with diabetes risk.  Some rTFA subtypes were inversely associated with diabetes risk: vaccenic acid (18:1n-7t; hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and t10c12-CLA (HR per SD 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94), whereas c9t11-CLA was positively associated (HR per SD 1.39; 95% CI 1.19-1.62).  Trans-palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7t) was not associated with diabetes risk when adjusting for the other TFAs (HR per SD 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.31).  The TFAs' conformation plays an essential role in their relationship to diabetes risk.  rTFA subtypes may have opposing relationships to diabetes risk.  Previous observations for reduced diabetes risk with higher levels of circulating trans-palmitoleic acid are likely due to confounding. 

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

Content of industrially produced trans fatty acids in breast milk: An observational study.  Breast milk may contain industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs), which can affect the content of essential fatty acids (EFAs).  This could have significant implications for the child's development.  The fatty acids present in breast milk can be modified by adjusting the mother's diet.  The objective of this study was to determine the content of industrially produced TFAs present in colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk produced by mothers between 18 and 45 years of age in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, based on a longitudinal observational study.  The TFA content in the breast milk of 33 lactating women was analyzed using gas chromatography.  The mothers' consumption of TFAs was also estimated by analyzing a log prepared through 24-hr dietary recall (24HR) obtained in each period.  The TFA content in the mothers' diet was similar across the colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk phases: 1.64 +/- 1.25 g, 1.39 +/- 1.01, and 1.66 +/- 1.13 g, respectively.  The total TFA content was 1.529% +/- 1.648% for colostrum; 0.748% +/- 1.033% for transitional milk and 0.945% +/- 1.368% for mature milk.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms and intermediate entities:

1. **Fatty Acid Metabolism**: The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence the balance of different fatty acids in the body, including monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs).
2. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: NAFLD is associated with altered fatty acid metabolism, which can lead to brain hypoperfusion and cognitive decline. The F3 wt Allele might contribute to the development of NAFLD, which in turn increases the risk of AD.
3. **Plasmalogen Levels**: Plasmalogens are a type of glycerophospholipid that play a crucial role in neuronal function. Low plasmalogen levels have been linked to AD. The F3 wt Allele might affect plasmalogen synthesis or degradation, leading to decreased plasmalogen levels and increased AD risk.
4. **Dietary Fatty Acids**: The F3 wt Allele might influence an individual's response to dietary fatty acids, such as MUFAs, PUFAs, and SFAs. A diet high in SFAs and low in MUFAs and PUFAs has been linked to an increased risk of AD.
5. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: The F3 wt Allele might contribute to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
6. **Blood-Brain Barrier Function**: The F3 wt Allele might affect the function of the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxic substances to enter the brain and contributing to AD pathology.
7. **Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Interaction**: The F3 wt Allele might interact with the APOE gene, which is a known risk factor for AD. This interaction could influence the risk of AD in individuals carrying the F3 wt Allele.

The possible indirect linkage between the F3 wt Allele and AD can be summarized as follows:

F3 wt Allele → Altered Fatty Acid Metabolism → NAFLD → Brain Hypoperfusion → Cognitive Decline → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Decreased Plasmalogen Levels → Neuronal Dysfunction → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Increased Inflammation and Oxidative Stress → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Impaired Blood-Brain Barrier Function → AD

or

F3 wt Allele → Interaction with APOE → Increased AD Risk

These hypothetical pathways highlight the potential indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD, involving various intermediate entities and mechanisms. However, further research is necessary to confirm these associations and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. The two major phospholipid classes, namely, phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylcholines (PC), were studied in four different regions of human brain, i.e., in frontal gray matter, frontal white matter, hippocampus and in pons. The fatty acid (FA) compositions of these phospholipids were found to be specific for the different regions. PC contains mostly saturated and 18:1 FA, while PE is rich in polyunsaturated FA. Aging has no influence on the FA compositions, while in Alzheimer's disease (AD) PE is modified in all four regions, particularly in frontal gray matter and in hippocampus. The abundance of the major monounsaturated FA of PE, 18:1, is not significantly altered in Alzheimer's disease, but there is a substantial increase in the relative amounts of the saturated components 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0. This is paralleled by a decrease in the polyunsaturated FA 20:4, 22:4 and 22:6. It is not clear whether the changes observed are specific for AD. Changes in saturated/polyunsaturated FA ratio are likely to influence cellular function, which in turn may cause certain neural deficiencies. The findings do not support the hypothesis that AD reflects an accelerated aging process.

Dietary fatty acids in dementia and predementia syndromes: epidemiological evidence and possible underlying mechanisms. Drugs currently used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia have a very limited therapeutic value, suggesting the necessity to potentially individualize new strategies able to prevent and to slow down the progression of predementia and dementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggested that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, a clear reduction of risk for cognitive decline has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. Epidemiological findings demonstrated that high PUFA intake appeared to have borderline non-significant trend for a protective effect against the development of MCI. Several hypotheses could explain the association between dietary unsaturated fatty acids and cognitive functioning, including mechanisms through the co-presence of antioxidant compounds in food groups rich in fatty acids, via atherosclerosis and thrombosis, inflammation, accumulation of b-amyloid, or via an effect in maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes, determining the fluidity of synaptosomal membranes that thereby regulate neuronal transmission. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms only in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired subjects non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data together with epidemiological evidence support a possible role of fatty acid intake in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning and possibly for the prevention and management of cognitive decline and dementia, but not when the AD process has already taken over.

Food combination and Alzheimer disease risk: a protective diet. To assess the association between food combination and Alzheimer disease (AD) risk. Because foods are not consumed in isolation, dietary pattern (DP) analysis of food combination, taking into account the interactions among food components, may offer methodological advantages. Prospective cohort study. Northern Manhattan, New York, New York. Two thousand one hundred forty-eight community-based elderly subjects (aged > or = 65 years) without dementia in New York provided dietary information and were prospectively evaluated with the same standardized neurological and neuropsychological measures approximately every 1.5 years. Using reduced rank regression, we calculated DPs based on their ability to explain variation in 7 potentially AD-related nutrients: saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin B(12), and folate. The associations of reduced rank regression-derived DPs with AD risk were then examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. Main Outcome Measure Incident AD risk. Two hundred fifty-three subjects developed AD during a follow-up of 3.9 years. We identified a DP strongly associated with lower AD risk: compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of adherence to this pattern, the AD hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for subjects in the highest DP tertile was 0.62 (0.43-0.89) after multivariable adjustment (P for trend = .01). This DP was characterized by higher intakes of salad dressing, nuts, fish, tomatoes, poultry, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, and dark and green leafy vegetables and a lower intake of high-fat dairy products, red meat, organ meat, and butter. Simultaneous consideration of previous knowledge regarding potentially AD-related nutrients and multiple food groups can aid in identifying food combinations that are associated with AD risk.

Olive oil and health: summary of the II international conference on olive oil and health consensus report, Jaen and Cordoba (Spain) 2008. Olive oil (OO) is the most representative food of the traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). Increasing evidence suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as a nutrient, OO as a food, and the MedDiet as a food pattern are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A MedDiet rich in OO and OO per se has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles, blood pressure, postprandial hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and antithrombotic profiles. Some of these beneficial effects can be attributed to the OO minor components. Therefore, the definition of the MedDiet should include OO. Phenolic compounds in OO have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, prevent lipoperoxidation, induce favorable changes of lipid profile, improve endothelial function, and disclose antithrombotic properties. Observational studies from Mediterranean cohorts have suggested that dietary MUFA may be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies consistently support the concept that the OO-rich MedDiet is compatible with healthier aging and increased longevity. In countries where the population adheres to the MedDiet, such as Spain, Greece and Italy, and OO is the principal source of fat, rates of cancer incidence are lower than in northern European countries. Experimental and human cellular studies have provided new evidence on the potential protective effect of OO on cancer. Furthermore, results of case-control and cohort studies suggest that MUFA intake including OO is associated with a reduction in cancer risk (mainly breast, colorectal and prostate cancers).

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

[Fatty acid composition of human breast milk across lactational stages in six representative cities in China from 2018 to 2019].  To investigate the fatty acid composition in breast milk at different lactation stages in six representative cities of China.  From January 2018 to December 2019, milk sampling of 690 healthy lactating mothers(full-term) in 5 lactation periods of 0-5 days, 10-14 days, 40-45 days, 200-240 days and 300-400 days was collected from 6 representative regions in China, with 23 cases of breast milk received in each lactation stage in each city.  Mix it into one mixture, and make a total of 30 mixes.  Determination of fatty acids in breast milk was conducted by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector.  The contents of total fatty acids(TFA), saturated fatty acids(SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA) in breast milk increased with the progress of lactation and reached a relatively stable level after reaching a peak at 40-45 days.  However, the composition ratio of SFA, MUFA and PUFA in TFA remained relatively stable from 0 to 400 days.  The ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic(AA/DHA) in breast milk from 0 to 400 days in the six cities ranged from 1.14 to 1.55, and there was no obvious trend of change in the whole lactation stage.  The ratio of linoleic acid to alpha-linolenic acid(LA/ALA) in Chinese breast milk ranged from 3.84 to 18.94, showing significant regional variation.  The content and composition of fatty acids in breast milk of six cities in China vary to a certain extent and show a dynamic change process with the passage of time of lactation. 

The activity of French research ethics committees and characteristics of biomedical research protocols involving humans: a retrospective cohort study. Clinical trials throughout the world must be evaluated by research ethics committees. No one has yet attempted to clearly quantify at the national level the activity of ethics committees and describe the characteristics of the protocols submitted. The objectives of this study were to describe 1) the workload and the activity of Research Ethics Committees in France, and 2) the characteristics of protocols approved on a nation-wide basis. Retrospective cohort of 976 protocols approved by a representative sample of 25/48 of French Research Ethics Committees in 1994. Protocols characteristics (design, study size, investigator), number of revisions requested by the ethics committee before approval, time to approval and number of amendments after approval were collected for each protocol by trained research assistant using the committee's files and archives. Thirty-one percent of protocols were approved with no modifications requested in 16 days (95% CI: 14-17). The number of revisions requested by the committee, and amendments submitted by the investigator was on average respectively 39 (95% CI: 25-53) and 37 (95% CI: 27-46), per committee and per year. When revisions were requested, the main reasons were related to information to the patient (28%) and consent modalities (18%). Drugs were the object of research in 68% of the protocols examined. The majority of the research was national (80%) with a predominance of single-centre studies. Workload per protocol has been estimated at twelve and half hours on average for administrative support and at eleven and half hours for expertise. The estimated workload justifies specific and independent administrative and financial support for Research Ethics Committees.

Hepatocyte function during experimental use of a bioartificial liver. The aim of the present study was to compare the function of fresh versus cryopreserved hepatocytes in an experimental bioartificial liver system (BAL), especially designed to reproduce clinical parameters. Our BAL consists of a pump, a plasma reservoir, a membrane oxygenator, and a hollow fiber module loaded with 5 x 10(9) isolated porcine hepatocytes, either fresh (n = 5) or cryopreserved (n = 5). In the present setting, the system was isolated and perfused for 6 hours with recirculating plasma obtained from pigs with ischemic liver failure (toxic plasma). The following parameters were studied at 0 and 6 hours: oxygen consumption by the hepatocytes in the bioreactor, hepatocyte viability, as well as plasma concentrations of AST, LDH, ammonia, urea, and total bilirubin. MEGX concentrations were measured following injection of lidocaine into the system 30 minutes after initiation of plasma recirculation. Compared to cryopreserved cells, fresh hepatocytes showed higher viability at both time points studied (P <.05). Furthermore, during BAL sessions, ammonia levels were reduced while urea, AST, and LDH levels were increased with both preservation types (P <.05). Total bilirubin levels increased only during sessions with cryopreserved hepatocytes. After lidocaine administration, both fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes were capable of producing MEGX; however, fresh-cell bioreactors produced significantly more MEGX at both 30 and 60 minutes after lidocaine administration. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher by fresh-cell bioreactors both before and after BAL use. In conclusion, hepatocytes in the BAL bioreactor showed preservation of important metabolic functions, when perfused with homologous toxic plasma. Fresh cells appeared to respond better than did cryopreserved ones.

Invasive aspergillosis in systemic lupus erythematosus. Invasive aspergillosis is seldomly described in systemic lupus erythematosus. We present two cases of aspergillosis and review 21 cases reported between 1957 and 1994. The typical clinical presentation is fever and cough in a hospitalized SLE patient previously treated with corticosteroids, immunosuppressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unlike aspergillosis in other conditions, granulocytopenia is uncommon. Chest radiographs show diffuse or patchy infiltration of lung fields. Diagnosis was suspected premortem in 2 patients. Aspergillus fumigatus was identified or isolated in sputum or parenchimal tissues in the majority of cases. Twenty-two patients died (95%). The finding of hyphae in the sputum of a systemic lupus erythematosus patient with a suggestive clinical picture should lead to bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy. Proof of diagnosis will come from the demonstration of hyphae in tissues and isolation of aspergillus from tissue cultures. Long-term therapy with amphotericin B alone or in combination with fluorocytosine or itraconazole may help improve survival.

Based on the provided abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through the following mechanisms:

1. **Fatty acid composition and brain health**: The first abstract suggests that changes in fatty acid composition, particularly an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids, are associated with Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and variations in this gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence fatty acid composition in the brain, potentially contributing to AD risk.
2. **Dietary fatty acids and cognitive decline**: The second abstract highlights the importance of dietary fatty acids in maintaining cognitive function and potentially preventing AD. A diet rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as those found in olive oil, may have a protective effect against cognitive decline. The F3 wt Allele might interact with dietary fatty acid intake to influence AD risk, with a potential synergistic effect between the allele and a healthy diet.
3. **Gut-brain axis and fatty acid metabolism**: The fifth abstract demonstrates that high-fat diets with different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis in obese mice. The F3 gene is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and alterations in this gene might affect the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to AD risk. The gut-brain axis is a key regulator of brain health, and changes in fatty acid metabolism might influence this axis, leading to an increased risk of AD.
4. **Olive oil and Mediterranean diet**: The fourth abstract highlights the potential benefits of olive oil and the Mediterranean diet in reducing AD risk. The F3 wt Allele might interact with the Mediterranean diet to influence AD risk, with a potential protective effect of the diet in individuals with the F3 wt Allele.
5. **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: Several abstracts mention the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis. The F3 gene is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and alterations in this gene might influence inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially contributing to AD risk.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the following pathways:

F3 wt Allele → altered fatty acid metabolism → changes in brain fatty acid composition → increased risk of AD
F3 wt Allele → interaction with dietary fatty acid intake → modulation of cognitive decline and AD risk
F3 wt Allele → altered gut-brain axis function → changes in brain health and increased AD risk
F3 wt Allele → interaction with Mediterranean diet → modulation of AD risk
F3 wt Allele → altered inflammation and oxidative stress → increased AD risk

These pathways are speculative and require further research to confirm the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease.

Fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. The two major phospholipid classes, namely, phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylcholines (PC), were studied in four different regions of human brain, i.e., in frontal gray matter, frontal white matter, hippocampus and in pons. The fatty acid (FA) compositions of these phospholipids were found to be specific for the different regions. PC contains mostly saturated and 18:1 FA, while PE is rich in polyunsaturated FA. Aging has no influence on the FA compositions, while in Alzheimer's disease (AD) PE is modified in all four regions, particularly in frontal gray matter and in hippocampus. The abundance of the major monounsaturated FA of PE, 18:1, is not significantly altered in Alzheimer's disease, but there is a substantial increase in the relative amounts of the saturated components 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0. This is paralleled by a decrease in the polyunsaturated FA 20:4, 22:4 and 22:6. It is not clear whether the changes observed are specific for AD. Changes in saturated/polyunsaturated FA ratio are likely to influence cellular function, which in turn may cause certain neural deficiencies. The findings do not support the hypothesis that AD reflects an accelerated aging process.

Dietary fatty acids in dementia and predementia syndromes: epidemiological evidence and possible underlying mechanisms. Drugs currently used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia have a very limited therapeutic value, suggesting the necessity to potentially individualize new strategies able to prevent and to slow down the progression of predementia and dementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggested that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, a clear reduction of risk for cognitive decline has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. Epidemiological findings demonstrated that high PUFA intake appeared to have borderline non-significant trend for a protective effect against the development of MCI. Several hypotheses could explain the association between dietary unsaturated fatty acids and cognitive functioning, including mechanisms through the co-presence of antioxidant compounds in food groups rich in fatty acids, via atherosclerosis and thrombosis, inflammation, accumulation of b-amyloid, or via an effect in maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes, determining the fluidity of synaptosomal membranes that thereby regulate neuronal transmission. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms only in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired subjects non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data together with epidemiological evidence support a possible role of fatty acid intake in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning and possibly for the prevention and management of cognitive decline and dementia, but not when the AD process has already taken over.

Multicentre international experience of 532-nm laser photoselective vaporization with GreenLight XPS in men with very large prostates. To describe peri-operative results, functional outcomes and complications of laser photoselective vaporization, using the GreenLight system, of prostate glands >=200 mL in volume. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained multicentre database was performed to select a subgroup of patients with very large prostates (volume >=200 mL) treated with the GreenLight XPS laser. A subgroup of patients with prostate volumes 100-200 mL was used for comparison. International Prostate Symptom Score, maximum urinary flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume and prostate-specific antigen levels were measured at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. Durability was evaluated using benign prostatic hyperplasia re-treatment rate at 12, 24 and 36 months. Additionally, complications were recorded using Clavien-Dindo classification. A total of 33 patients (38%) had prostates >=200 mL. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with prostates >=200 mL and those with prostates 100-200 mL. Patients with very large prostates (>=200 mL) had longer operating times (129 vs 93 min), less energy delivered, a greater number of fibres used (3 vs 2) and a higher conversion rate to transurethral resection of the prostate (16% vs 4%). In terms of complications and functional outcomes, we did not find any differences between the groups. Retreatment rate was also comparable. Our results show that PVP GreenLight XPS-180W is an acceptable technique for very large prostates (>=200 mL); however, operating times, energy delivery, fibres used and conversion to TURP are a concern in this particular subgroup. This should be used for patient counselling and surgery planning.

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

[Fatty acid composition of human breast milk across lactational stages in six representative cities in China from 2018 to 2019].  To investigate the fatty acid composition in breast milk at different lactation stages in six representative cities of China.  From January 2018 to December 2019, milk sampling of 690 healthy lactating mothers(full-term) in 5 lactation periods of 0-5 days, 10-14 days, 40-45 days, 200-240 days and 300-400 days was collected from 6 representative regions in China, with 23 cases of breast milk received in each lactation stage in each city.  Mix it into one mixture, and make a total of 30 mixes.  Determination of fatty acids in breast milk was conducted by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector.  The contents of total fatty acids(TFA), saturated fatty acids(SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA) in breast milk increased with the progress of lactation and reached a relatively stable level after reaching a peak at 40-45 days.  However, the composition ratio of SFA, MUFA and PUFA in TFA remained relatively stable from 0 to 400 days.  The ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic(AA/DHA) in breast milk from 0 to 400 days in the six cities ranged from 1.14 to 1.55, and there was no obvious trend of change in the whole lactation stage.  The ratio of linoleic acid to alpha-linolenic acid(LA/ALA) in Chinese breast milk ranged from 3.84 to 18.94, showing significant regional variation.  The content and composition of fatty acids in breast milk of six cities in China vary to a certain extent and show a dynamic change process with the passage of time of lactation. 

The activity of French research ethics committees and characteristics of biomedical research protocols involving humans: a retrospective cohort study. Clinical trials throughout the world must be evaluated by research ethics committees. No one has yet attempted to clearly quantify at the national level the activity of ethics committees and describe the characteristics of the protocols submitted. The objectives of this study were to describe 1) the workload and the activity of Research Ethics Committees in France, and 2) the characteristics of protocols approved on a nation-wide basis. Retrospective cohort of 976 protocols approved by a representative sample of 25/48 of French Research Ethics Committees in 1994. Protocols characteristics (design, study size, investigator), number of revisions requested by the ethics committee before approval, time to approval and number of amendments after approval were collected for each protocol by trained research assistant using the committee's files and archives. Thirty-one percent of protocols were approved with no modifications requested in 16 days (95% CI: 14-17). The number of revisions requested by the committee, and amendments submitted by the investigator was on average respectively 39 (95% CI: 25-53) and 37 (95% CI: 27-46), per committee and per year. When revisions were requested, the main reasons were related to information to the patient (28%) and consent modalities (18%). Drugs were the object of research in 68% of the protocols examined. The majority of the research was national (80%) with a predominance of single-centre studies. Workload per protocol has been estimated at twelve and half hours on average for administrative support and at eleven and half hours for expertise. The estimated workload justifies specific and independent administrative and financial support for Research Ethics Committees.

Hepatocyte function during experimental use of a bioartificial liver. The aim of the present study was to compare the function of fresh versus cryopreserved hepatocytes in an experimental bioartificial liver system (BAL), especially designed to reproduce clinical parameters. Our BAL consists of a pump, a plasma reservoir, a membrane oxygenator, and a hollow fiber module loaded with 5 x 10(9) isolated porcine hepatocytes, either fresh (n = 5) or cryopreserved (n = 5). In the present setting, the system was isolated and perfused for 6 hours with recirculating plasma obtained from pigs with ischemic liver failure (toxic plasma). The following parameters were studied at 0 and 6 hours: oxygen consumption by the hepatocytes in the bioreactor, hepatocyte viability, as well as plasma concentrations of AST, LDH, ammonia, urea, and total bilirubin. MEGX concentrations were measured following injection of lidocaine into the system 30 minutes after initiation of plasma recirculation. Compared to cryopreserved cells, fresh hepatocytes showed higher viability at both time points studied (P <.05). Furthermore, during BAL sessions, ammonia levels were reduced while urea, AST, and LDH levels were increased with both preservation types (P <.05). Total bilirubin levels increased only during sessions with cryopreserved hepatocytes. After lidocaine administration, both fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes were capable of producing MEGX; however, fresh-cell bioreactors produced significantly more MEGX at both 30 and 60 minutes after lidocaine administration. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher by fresh-cell bioreactors both before and after BAL use. In conclusion, hepatocytes in the BAL bioreactor showed preservation of important metabolic functions, when perfused with homologous toxic plasma. Fresh cells appeared to respond better than did cryopreserved ones.

Invasive aspergillosis in systemic lupus erythematosus. Invasive aspergillosis is seldomly described in systemic lupus erythematosus. We present two cases of aspergillosis and review 21 cases reported between 1957 and 1994. The typical clinical presentation is fever and cough in a hospitalized SLE patient previously treated with corticosteroids, immunosuppressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unlike aspergillosis in other conditions, granulocytopenia is uncommon. Chest radiographs show diffuse or patchy infiltration of lung fields. Diagnosis was suspected premortem in 2 patients. Aspergillus fumigatus was identified or isolated in sputum or parenchimal tissues in the majority of cases. Twenty-two patients died (95%). The finding of hyphae in the sputum of a systemic lupus erythematosus patient with a suggestive clinical picture should lead to bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy. Proof of diagnosis will come from the demonstration of hyphae in tissues and isolation of aspergillus from tissue cultures. Long-term therapy with amphotericin B alone or in combination with fluorocytosine or itraconazole may help improve survival.

To describe a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and connect the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes. 

1. **Fatty Acid Composition and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract highlights changes in the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in Alzheimer's disease, particularly an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. This alteration could affect cellular function and contribute to neural deficiencies.

2. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline**: The second abstract discusses the epidemiological evidence suggesting that dietary patterns rich in unsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish, olive oil) may have a protective effect against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. This implies that the type of dietary fatty acids could influence the risk of developing AD.

3. **Olive Oil, Mediterranean Diet, and Health**: The third abstract reinforces the idea that the Mediterranean Diet, characterized by high consumption of olive oil (rich in monounsaturated fatty acids), is associated with a reduced risk of several diseases, including Alzheimer's. This diet's potential protective effects on cognitive decline could be mediated through its fatty acid composition.

4. **Gut-Brain Axis and Fatty Acids**: The abstract on high-fat diets and the gut-brain axis in obese mice suggests that different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis, potentially influencing metabolic responses and cognitive functions. This indicates a complex interaction between dietary fatty acids, gut health, and brain function.

Given these points, a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be hypothesized as follows:

- **F3 wt Allele Influence on Fatty Acid Metabolism**: If the F3 wt Allele influences fatty acid metabolism or the composition of fatty acids in the body (possibly through effects on enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis or degradation), this could, in turn, affect the types of fatty acids available for incorporation into brain phospholipids.

- **Impact on Brain Phospholipid Composition**: Changes in the availability of certain fatty acids for brain phospholipid synthesis could lead to alterations in the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids, similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease (increased saturated, decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids).

- **Influence on Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease Risk**: The altered brain phospholipid composition could then contribute to an increased risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, potentially through mechanisms involving changes in membrane fluidity, neuronal transmission, and susceptibility to oxidative stress or inflammation.

- **Dietary Interventions as Modulators**: The relationship between dietary fatty acid intake and Alzheimer's disease risk suggests that dietary patterns (e.g., high intake of unsaturated fatty acids) could modulate this risk. If the F3 wt Allele affects how dietary fatty acids are metabolized or utilized, this could further influence an individual's risk profile for Alzheimer's disease based on their diet.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could involve the allele's influence on fatty acid metabolism, which in turn affects brain phospholipid composition and, consequently, the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Dietary patterns rich in certain types of fatty acids could play a crucial role in modulating this risk. However, this hypothesis requires further research to understand the specific mechanisms and interactions involved.

Fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. The two major phospholipid classes, namely, phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylcholines (PC), were studied in four different regions of human brain, i.e., in frontal gray matter, frontal white matter, hippocampus and in pons. The fatty acid (FA) compositions of these phospholipids were found to be specific for the different regions. PC contains mostly saturated and 18:1 FA, while PE is rich in polyunsaturated FA. Aging has no influence on the FA compositions, while in Alzheimer's disease (AD) PE is modified in all four regions, particularly in frontal gray matter and in hippocampus. The abundance of the major monounsaturated FA of PE, 18:1, is not significantly altered in Alzheimer's disease, but there is a substantial increase in the relative amounts of the saturated components 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0. This is paralleled by a decrease in the polyunsaturated FA 20:4, 22:4 and 22:6. It is not clear whether the changes observed are specific for AD. Changes in saturated/polyunsaturated FA ratio are likely to influence cellular function, which in turn may cause certain neural deficiencies. The findings do not support the hypothesis that AD reflects an accelerated aging process.

Dietary fatty acids in dementia and predementia syndromes: epidemiological evidence and possible underlying mechanisms. Drugs currently used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia have a very limited therapeutic value, suggesting the necessity to potentially individualize new strategies able to prevent and to slow down the progression of predementia and dementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggested that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, a clear reduction of risk for cognitive decline has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. Epidemiological findings demonstrated that high PUFA intake appeared to have borderline non-significant trend for a protective effect against the development of MCI. Several hypotheses could explain the association between dietary unsaturated fatty acids and cognitive functioning, including mechanisms through the co-presence of antioxidant compounds in food groups rich in fatty acids, via atherosclerosis and thrombosis, inflammation, accumulation of b-amyloid, or via an effect in maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes, determining the fluidity of synaptosomal membranes that thereby regulate neuronal transmission. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms only in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired subjects non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data together with epidemiological evidence support a possible role of fatty acid intake in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning and possibly for the prevention and management of cognitive decline and dementia, but not when the AD process has already taken over.

Olive oil and health: summary of the II international conference on olive oil and health consensus report, Jaen and Cordoba (Spain) 2008. Olive oil (OO) is the most representative food of the traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). Increasing evidence suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as a nutrient, OO as a food, and the MedDiet as a food pattern are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A MedDiet rich in OO and OO per se has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles, blood pressure, postprandial hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and antithrombotic profiles. Some of these beneficial effects can be attributed to the OO minor components. Therefore, the definition of the MedDiet should include OO. Phenolic compounds in OO have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, prevent lipoperoxidation, induce favorable changes of lipid profile, improve endothelial function, and disclose antithrombotic properties. Observational studies from Mediterranean cohorts have suggested that dietary MUFA may be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies consistently support the concept that the OO-rich MedDiet is compatible with healthier aging and increased longevity. In countries where the population adheres to the MedDiet, such as Spain, Greece and Italy, and OO is the principal source of fat, rates of cancer incidence are lower than in northern European countries. Experimental and human cellular studies have provided new evidence on the potential protective effect of OO on cancer. Furthermore, results of case-control and cohort studies suggest that MUFA intake including OO is associated with a reduction in cancer risk (mainly breast, colorectal and prostate cancers).

Multicentre international experience of 532-nm laser photoselective vaporization with GreenLight XPS in men with very large prostates. To describe peri-operative results, functional outcomes and complications of laser photoselective vaporization, using the GreenLight system, of prostate glands >=200 mL in volume. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained multicentre database was performed to select a subgroup of patients with very large prostates (volume >=200 mL) treated with the GreenLight XPS laser. A subgroup of patients with prostate volumes 100-200 mL was used for comparison. International Prostate Symptom Score, maximum urinary flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume and prostate-specific antigen levels were measured at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. Durability was evaluated using benign prostatic hyperplasia re-treatment rate at 12, 24 and 36 months. Additionally, complications were recorded using Clavien-Dindo classification. A total of 33 patients (38%) had prostates >=200 mL. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with prostates >=200 mL and those with prostates 100-200 mL. Patients with very large prostates (>=200 mL) had longer operating times (129 vs 93 min), less energy delivered, a greater number of fibres used (3 vs 2) and a higher conversion rate to transurethral resection of the prostate (16% vs 4%). In terms of complications and functional outcomes, we did not find any differences between the groups. Retreatment rate was also comparable. Our results show that PVP GreenLight XPS-180W is an acceptable technique for very large prostates (>=200 mL); however, operating times, energy delivery, fibres used and conversion to TURP are a concern in this particular subgroup. This should be used for patient counselling and surgery planning.

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism.

Aegilops sharonensis genome-assisted identification of stem rust resistance gene Sr62.  The wild relatives and progenitors of wheat have been widely used as sources of disease resistance (R) genes.  Molecular identification and characterization of these R genes facilitates their manipulation and tracking in breeding programmes.  Here, we develop a reference-quality genome assembly of the wild diploid wheat relative Aegilops sharonensis and use positional mapping, mutagenesis, RNA-Seq and transgenesis to identify the stem rust resistance gene Sr62, which has also been transferred to common wheat.  This gene encodes a tandem kinase, homologues of which exist across multiple taxa in the plant kingdom.  Stable Sr62 transgenic wheat lines show high levels of resistance against diverse isolates of the stem rust pathogen, highlighting the utility of Sr62 for deployment as part of a polygenic stack to maximize the durability of stem rust resistance.

To describe a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and connect the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes. Although none of the abstracts directly mention the F3 wt Allele, we can infer a potential indirect relationship through the discussion of fatty acid composition, dietary influences on cognitive decline, and the role of fatty acids in neural function and disease.

1. **Fatty Acid Composition and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract discusses changes in the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in Alzheimer's disease, noting an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. This alteration in fatty acid composition could influence cellular function and contribute to neural deficiencies associated with AD.

2. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline**: The second abstract highlights the epidemiological evidence suggesting that dietary patterns rich in unsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish, olive oil) may have a protective effect against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, high intake of saturated fatty acids is associated with negative effects on cognitive health.

3. **Olive Oil, Mediterranean Diet, and Health**: The third abstract emphasizes the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, which is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) from olive oil. This dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and possibly a lower risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.

4. **Fatty Acids, Gut-Brain Axis, and Metabolic Responses**: The abstract on high-fat diets and the gut-brain axis in obese mice suggests that different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis, leading to distinct alterations in metabolic responses. This could imply that the type of dietary fatty acids influences not only metabolic health but also brain function and potentially the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Given these points, a hypothetical indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be proposed as follows:

- **Genetic Influence on Fatty Acid Metabolism**: Assume that the F3 wt Allele influences fatty acid metabolism or the preference for certain types of dietary fatty acids. This could be through encoding a protein involved in lipid metabolism or by affecting the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis or degradation.

- **Dietary Fatty Acid Intake and Alzheimer's Risk**: The type and amount of dietary fatty acids consumed could influence an individual's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, as suggested by the epidemiological evidence on dietary patterns and cognitive health.

- **Mechanistic Link**: The mechanism linking dietary fatty acids to Alzheimer's disease could involve the modification of brain phospholipid composition, inflammation, oxidative stress, or the maintenance of the structural integrity of neuronal membranes. These factors could, in turn, affect the accumulation of amyloid-beta, tau phosphorylation, or other pathological features of Alzheimer's disease.

- **Indirect Relationship**: If the F3 wt Allele affects an individual's fatty acid metabolism or dietary preferences, and if these factors influence the risk of Alzheimer's disease, then there could be an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease. This relationship would be mediated by the intermediate effects on fatty acid metabolism and dietary intake.

This narrative connects the abstracts by highlighting the importance of fatty acid composition in health and disease, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease. It proposes a potential pathway through which genetic factors influencing fatty acid metabolism could indirectly affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, it's crucial to note that this is a speculative connection based on the information provided and would require direct research evidence to confirm the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease.

Fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. The two major phospholipid classes, namely, phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylcholines (PC), were studied in four different regions of human brain, i.e., in frontal gray matter, frontal white matter, hippocampus and in pons. The fatty acid (FA) compositions of these phospholipids were found to be specific for the different regions. PC contains mostly saturated and 18:1 FA, while PE is rich in polyunsaturated FA. Aging has no influence on the FA compositions, while in Alzheimer's disease (AD) PE is modified in all four regions, particularly in frontal gray matter and in hippocampus.

This is paralleled by a decrease in the polyunsaturated FA 20:4, 22:4 and 22:6. It is not clear whether the changes observed are specific for AD. Changes in saturated/polyunsaturated FA ratio are likely to influence cellular function, which in turn may cause certain neural deficiencies. The findings do not support the hypothesis that AD reflects an accelerated aging process.

Dietary fatty acids in dementia and predementia syndromes: epidemiological evidence and possible underlying mechanisms. Drugs currently used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia have a very limited therapeutic value, suggesting the necessity to potentially individualize new strategies able to prevent and to slow down the progression of predementia and dementia syndromes. An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggested that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, a clear reduction of risk for cognitive decline has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3 PUFA. Epidemiological findings demonstrated that high PUFA intake appeared to have borderline non-significant trend for a protective effect against the development of MCI. Several hypotheses could explain the association between dietary unsaturated fatty acids and cognitive functioning, including mechanisms through the co-presence of antioxidant compounds in food groups rich in fatty acids, via atherosclerosis and thrombosis, inflammation, accumulation of b-amyloid, or via an effect in maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes, determining the fluidity of synaptosomal membranes that thereby regulate neuronal transmission. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n-3 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms only in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired subjects non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. These data together with epidemiological evidence support a possible role of fatty acid intake in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning and possibly for the prevention and management of cognitive decline and dementia, but not when the AD process has already taken over.

Olive oil and health: summary of the II international conference on olive oil and health consensus report, Jaen and Cordoba (Spain) 2008. Olive oil (OO) is the most representative food of the traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). Increasing evidence suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as a nutrient, OO as a food, and the MedDiet as a food pattern are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A MedDiet rich in OO and OO per se has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles, blood pressure, postprandial hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and antithrombotic profiles. Some of these beneficial effects can be attributed to the OO minor components. Therefore, the definition of the MedDiet should include OO. Phenolic compounds in OO have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, prevent lipoperoxidation, induce favorable changes of lipid profile, improve endothelial function, and disclose antithrombotic properties. Observational studies from Mediterranean cohorts have suggested that dietary MUFA may be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies consistently support the concept that the OO-rich MedDiet is compatible with healthier aging and increased longevity. In countries where the population adheres to the MedDiet, such as Spain, Greece and Italy, and OO is the principal source of fat, rates of cancer incidence are lower than in northern European countries. Experimental and human cellular studies have provided new evidence on the potential protective effect of OO on cancer. Furthermore, results of case-control and cohort studies suggest that MUFA intake including OO is associated with a reduction in cancer risk (mainly breast, colorectal and prostate cancers).

Second annual meeting of the American Society for Neural Transplantation.

Multicentre international experience of 532-nm laser photoselective vaporization with GreenLight XPS in men with very large prostates. To describe peri-operative results, functional outcomes and complications of laser photoselective vaporization, using the GreenLight system, of prostate glands >=200 mL in volume. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained multicentre database was performed to select a subgroup of patients with very large prostates (volume >=200 mL) treated with the GreenLight XPS laser. A subgroup of patients with prostate volumes 100-200 mL was used for comparison. International Prostate Symptom Score, maximum urinary flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume and prostate-specific antigen levels were measured at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. Durability was evaluated using benign prostatic hyperplasia re-treatment rate at 12, 24 and 36 months. Additionally, complications were recorded using Clavien-Dindo classification. A total of 33 patients (38%) had prostates >=200 mL. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with prostates >=200 mL and those with prostates 100-200 mL. Patients with very large prostates (>=200 mL) had longer operating times (129 vs 93 min), less energy delivered, a greater number of fibres used (3 vs 2) and a higher conversion rate to transurethral resection of the prostate (16% vs 4%). In terms of complications and functional outcomes, we did not find any differences between the groups. Retreatment rate was also comparable. Our results show that PVP GreenLight XPS-180W is an acceptable technique for very large prostates (>=200 mL); however, operating times, energy delivery, fibres used and conversion to TURP are a concern in this particular subgroup. This should be used for patient counselling and surgery planning.

High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids modulate gut-brain axis in obese mice.  Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases.  High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.  In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks.  To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.  All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice.  For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05).  The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).  The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism. 

The activity of French research ethics committees and characteristics of biomedical research protocols involving humans: a retrospective cohort study. Clinical trials throughout the world must be evaluated by research ethics committees. No one has yet attempted to clearly quantify at the national level the activity of ethics committees and describe the characteristics of the protocols submitted. The objectives of this study were to describe 1) the workload and the activity of Research Ethics Committees in France, and 2) the characteristics of protocols approved on a nation-wide basis. Retrospective cohort of 976 protocols approved by a representative sample of 25/48 of French Research Ethics Committees in 1994. Protocols characteristics (design, study size, investigator), number of revisions requested by the ethics committee before approval, time to approval and number of amendments after approval were collected for each protocol by trained research assistant using the committee's files and archives. Thirty-one percent of protocols were approved with no modifications requested in 16 days (95% CI: 14-17). The number of revisions requested by the committee, and amendments submitted by the investigator was on average respectively 39 (95% CI: 25-53) and 37 (95% CI: 27-46), per committee and per year. When revisions were requested, the main reasons were related to information to the patient (28%) and consent modalities (18%). Drugs were the object of research in 68% of the protocols examined. The majority of the research was national (80%) with a predominance of single-centre studies. Workload per protocol has been estimated at twelve and half hours on average for administrative support and at eleven and half hours for expertise. The estimated workload justifies specific and independent administrative and financial support for Research Ethics Committees.

Hepatocyte function during experimental use of a bioartificial liver. The aim of the present study was to compare the function of fresh versus cryopreserved hepatocytes in an experimental bioartificial liver system (BAL), especially designed to reproduce clinical parameters. Our BAL consists of a pump, a plasma reservoir, a membrane oxygenator, and a hollow fiber module loaded with 5 x 10(9) isolated porcine hepatocytes, either fresh (n = 5) or cryopreserved (n = 5). In the present setting, the system was isolated and perfused for 6 hours with recirculating plasma obtained from pigs with ischemic liver failure (toxic plasma). The following parameters were studied at 0 and 6 hours: oxygen consumption by the hepatocytes in the bioreactor, hepatocyte viability, as well as plasma concentrations of AST, LDH, ammonia, urea, and total bilirubin. MEGX concentrations were measured following injection of lidocaine into the system 30 minutes after initiation of plasma recirculation. Compared to cryopreserved cells, fresh hepatocytes showed higher viability at both time points studied (P <.05). Furthermore, during BAL sessions, ammonia levels were reduced while urea, AST, and LDH levels were increased with both preservation types (P <.05). Total bilirubin levels increased only during sessions with cryopreserved hepatocytes. After lidocaine administration, both fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes were capable of producing MEGX; however, fresh-cell bioreactors produced significantly more MEGX at both 30 and 60 minutes after lidocaine administration. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher by fresh-cell bioreactors both before and after BAL use. In conclusion, hepatocytes in the BAL bioreactor showed preservation of important metabolic functions, when perfused with homologous toxic plasma. Fresh cells appeared to respond better than did cryopreserved ones.

Aegilops sharonensis genome-assisted identification of stem rust resistance gene Sr62.  The wild relatives and progenitors of wheat have been widely used as sources of disease resistance (R) genes.  Molecular identification and characterization of these R genes facilitates their manipulation and tracking in breeding programmes.  Here, we develop a reference-quality genome assembly of the wild diploid wheat relative Aegilops sharonensis and use positional mapping, mutagenesis, RNA-Seq and transgenesis to identify the stem rust resistance gene Sr62, which has also been transferred to common wheat.  This gene encodes a tandem kinase, homologues of which exist across multiple taxa in the plant kingdom.  Stable Sr62 transgenic wheat lines show high levels of resistance against diverse isolates of the stem rust pathogen, highlighting the utility of Sr62 for deployment as part of a polygenic stack to maximize the durability of stem rust resistance. 

Apoptosis of fetal testicular cells is regulated by both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms. A portion of fetal germ cells undergoes apoptosis in the physiological context, but the molecular mechanisms of their apoptosis are largely unknown. Because p53 tumor suppressor gene product promotes apoptosis in various types of cells, we have investigated the expression of p53 in fetal gonads and examined the influence of loss of p53 function in fetal gonad cells using mice deficient in the p53 gene. We found that the expression of p53 protein in fetal testis was induced after 15.5 dpc (days post coitum), while the expression was not detected in fetal ovary. The number of apoptotic cells found in the seminiferous tubules of fetal testes was not significantly different between p53-deficient and wild-type mice until 16.5 dpc. At 17.5 dpc, however, more apoptotic cells were observed in wild-type testes than in the p53-deficient mice. In contrast, a similar number of apoptotic cells was found in fetal ovaries throughout these developmental stages. These observations indicate that p53 promotes apoptosis of fetal testicular cells after 16.5 dpc.

To describe a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we must consider the key findings and mechanisms mentioned in the provided abstracts, even though none directly mention the F3 wt Allele. The connection can be hypothesized through the discussion of fatty acid compositions, dietary influences on cognitive decline, and the role of specific fatty acids in neurological health.

1. **Fatty Acid Composition and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract discusses changes in brain phospholipid fatty acid composition in Alzheimer's disease, noting an increase in saturated fatty acids and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. This alteration could affect neuronal membrane fluidity and, consequently, neuronal function.

2. **Dietary Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline**: The second abstract highlights epidemiological evidence suggesting that dietary patterns rich in unsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish and olive oil) may have a protective effect against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, high intake of saturated fatty acids is associated with negative effects on cognitive health.

3. **Olive Oil, Monounsaturated Fatty Acids, and Health**: The third abstract emphasizes the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, which is rich in olive oil and monounsaturated fatty acids, in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and possibly protecting against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.

4. **Gut-Brain Axis and Fatty Acids**: The abstract on high-fat diets and the gut-brain axis in obese mice suggests that different types of fatty acids can modulate the gut-brain axis, potentially influencing metabolic responses and neurological health. This implies that dietary fatty acid composition could indirectly affect the risk or progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Given these points, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be hypothesized as follows:

- **Genetic Influence on Fatty Acid Metabolism**: If the F3 wt Allele influences fatty acid metabolism or the preference for certain types of fatty acids in the diet, it could indirectly affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. For instance, if the allele is associated with a higher intake or metabolism of saturated fatty acids, this could lead to changes in brain phospholipid composition that are detrimental to neuronal health.

- **Dietary Patterns and Genetic Predisposition**: Individuals with the F3 wt Allele might have a genetic predisposition to prefer or metabolize certain dietary fatty acids differently. If this predisposition leads to a higher intake of protective fatty acids (like omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish or monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil), it could offer some protection against cognitive decline. Conversely, a predisposition towards a diet high in saturated fats could increase the risk.

- **Gut-Brain Axis Modulation**: The allele could potentially influence the gut-brain axis by affecting the metabolism or transport of fatty acids, thereby modulating the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. This could occur through changes in the intestinal barrier function, inflammation levels, or the production of neuroactive compounds that influence brain health.

In summary, while the abstracts do not directly link the F3 wt Allele to Alzheimer's Disease, they provide a framework for understanding how genetic factors influencing fatty acid metabolism or dietary preferences could indirectly impact the risk of developing Alzheimer's. This relationship would depend on how the allele affects fatty acid composition in the brain, dietary patterns, and the modulation of the gut-brain axis.

Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate in Alzheimer's disease. Renal disease is increasingly regarded as an independent risk factor for vascular disease which in itself is believed to influence risk of AD. ) may represent another potential role for variation in renal function leading to increased risk of AD. We sought to examine estimates of glomerular filtration rate in AD and control groups. AD patients were randomly recruited from the Memory Clinic of the Belfast City Hospital (n = 83). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leucocytes and was genotyped for Apolipoprotein E using standard methods. Using creatinine values, age and gender, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (eGFR) were calculated using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation (using the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UKNEQAS) correction factor). IDMS eGFR values were then compared between AD and control groups. 4 carriage were noted between cases and controls. The AD group had a significantly lower eGFR versus controls (69 vs 77 ml/min) which persisted after adjustment for possible confounders (p = 0.045). This case-control analysis suggests that using a relatively accurate estimate of renal function, patients with AD have greater renal impairment than cognitively normal controls. or be a marker of shared vascular processes altering cerebral and renal functioning.

Breakdown of the Cerebrovasculature and Blood-Brain Barrier: A Mechanistic Link Between Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are among the most pervasive and devastating disorders that afflict people throughout the world. Although typically associated with older demographics, recent epidemiologic studies have reported parallel trends in decreasing age of onset and increasing incidence of these conditions. Promising research continues to implicate the cerebrovasculature and blood-brain barrier (BBB) as playing key roles in AD pathoetiology. Similarly, complications accompanying DM, such as diabetic nephropathy/retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, have been rooted in vascular compromise. Not surprisingly, DM is now considered a major risk factor for AD. The purpose of this review is to highlight investigations into the role of the cerebrovasculature in the development and progression of AD. We give particular attention to studies on humans and a variety of animal model systems that have demonstrated a link between BBB dysfunction and pathological changes in the brain consistent with aging and AD. Together, these studies suggest that the vascular complications associated with chronic, poorly managed DM can lead to subclinical BBB breakdown that precedes and drives the pathological changes progressing to symptomatic AD, providing a common mechanistic thread connecting these two disorders. Furthermore, this emphasizes the need to focus on the vasculature as a potential therapeutic target with the intent of limiting BBB breakdown involved in disease initiation and progression. In conclusion, AD may be more than just an associated comorbidity of DM, and instead another manifestation of the underlying vascular pathology that is common to both.

The probable involvement of soluble and deposited melanins, their intermediates and the reactive oxygen side-products in human diseases and aging. The plasma soluble melanins (PSM) form spontaneously in vitro and in vivo and their formation involves oxidative polymerization and copolymerization of dopa, catecholamines, homogentisic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, p-aminophenol, p-phenylenediamine, and other end(ex)ogenous ortho and para polyhydroxy-, (poly)hydroxy(poly)amino- and polyamino-phenyl compounds. The build up of PSM is visible within 2-3 h after the start of incubation at 37 degrees C with 1 mg/ml of plasma. PSM also form similarly in blood and these processes cause hemolysis. The mean quantity of PSM in normal human plasma is 1.61+/-0.1 (S.D.) mg/ml (n = 20) and in normal human urine is 1.1+/-1.2 g/24 h collection (n = 8). They contribute to the yellow color of plasma and urine. Antioxidants delay the formation of PSM. The deposited melanins also form from these precursors. Reactive oxygen side products (ROSP) are generated during and after melanogenesis. Melanins in vivo are generally associated with proteins or with proteins and lipids. The PSM-protein-lipid complexes are called plasma soluble lipofuscins (PSL), because they have histochemical and fluorescence properties similar to those of solid lipofuscins. The soluble and deposited melanins (SDM) and their intermediates have similar toxic chemical reactivities. The oxidizing quinoid (they can produce partially and completely substituted conjugates) and the semiquinoid free radical intermediates are also moieties in most human melanin structures. Soluble melanins formed from dopa, or dopamine, or norepinephrine in weak alkaline solution have been shown to be toxic to human CD4+ lymphoblastic cells (MT-2) at higher than 10 microg/ml concentrations. Alkaptonuria with high levels of homogentisic acid in the plasma is a potentially fatal disease, exhibiting the toxic effects of the homogentisic acid melanin (soluble and deposited), its intermediates and the ROSP. Patients with alkaptonuria develop arthritis and often suffer from other diseases too, including cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death) and kidney disease. Pheochromocytoma, with high levels of catecholamines in the plasma is another potentially fatal disease. The catecholamine PSM of pheochromocytoma have very light yellow or practically no colors, due to the concentrations and chemical structures. Pheochromocytomas can cause hypertension, cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death), kidney disease, stroke, cancer, amyloid formation and can mimic many other diseases, including acute pancreatitis, carcinoid, neuroblastoma, psychiatric illness, hypercalcemia, retinal vascular lesions, and diabetes mellitus. Pheochromocytoma is potentially fatal even in patients without hypertension. Following trauma and surgery, heavily pigmented eyes are apt to experience greater inflammation than lightly pigmented eyes. In Parkinson's disease those neurons are lost first in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus which contain the greatest amounts of neuromelanins. The antihypertensive alphamethyldopa causes Parkinson's syndrome. It forms PSM in a short time in vitro. The side effects of L-dopa (immobility episodes alternate with normal or involuntary movements; psychotic abnormalities) suggest that the SDM, their intermediates and the ROSP present naturally in vivo are involved in the cause of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. There is a large overlap between these two diseases. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation on eye lens protein by rutin. Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) plays a key role in the several pathophysiologies associated with ageing and diabetes, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, chronic renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's disease, nephropathy, neuropathy and cataract. This raises the possibility of inhibition of AGE formation as one of the approaches to prevent or arrest the progression of diabetic complications. Previously, we have reported that some common dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices have the potential to inhibit AGE formation. Flavonoids are abundantly found in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and rutin is one of the commonly found dietary flavonols. In the present study, we have demonstrated the antiglycating potential and mechanism of action of rutin using goat eye lens proteins as model proteins. Under in vitro conditions, rutin inhibited glycation as assessed by SDS-PAGE, AGE-fluorescence, boronate affinity chromatography and immunodetection of specific AGE. Further, we provided insight into the mechanism of inhibition of protein glycation that rutin not only scavenges free-radicals directly but also chelates the metal ions by forming complexes with them and thereby partly inhibiting post-Amadori formation. These findings indicate the potential of rutin to prevent and/or inhibit protein glycation and the prospects for controlling AGE-mediated diabetic pathological conditions in vivo.

Alternative routes for the formation of immunochemically distinct advanced glycation end-products in vivo. The advanced stage of the glycation process (also called the "Maillard reaction") that leads to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of angiopathy in diabetic patients and in the aging process. AGEs elicit a wide range of cell-mediated responses that might contribute to diabetic complications, vascular disease, renal disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, it has been proposed that AGE are not only created from glucose per se, but also from dicarbonyl compounds derived from glycation, sugar autoxidation, and sugar metabolism. However, this advanced stage of glycation is still only partially characterized and the structures of the different AGEs that are generated in vivo have not been completely determined. Because of their heterogeneity and the complexity of the chemical reactions involved, only some AGEs have been characterized in vivo, including N-carboxymethyllysine (CML), pentosidine, pyrraline, and crosslines. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the pathways of AGE formation and of the immunochemical methods for detection of AGEs, and we also provide direct immunological evidence for the existence of five distinct AGE classes (designated as AGE-1 to -5) within the AGE-modified proteins and peptides in the serum of diabetic patients on hemodialysis. We also propose pathways for the in vivo formation of various AGEs by glycation, sugar autoxidation, and sugar metabolism.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 in a family with diabetes and mild kidney disease diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. Exome sequencing is being increasingly used to identify disease-associated gene mutations. We used whole exome sequencing to determine the genetic basis of a syndrome of diabetes and renal disease affecting a mother and her son. We identified a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-b (HNF1B) gene that encoded a methionine to valine amino acid change (M160V) in the HNF1B protein. This leads us to the previously unappreciated diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and provided a basis for genetic counselling of other family members.

The glycine betaine role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases: Insights into disease and dysfunction networks. Glycine betaine (N, N, N-trimethyl amine) is an osmolyte accumulated in cells that is key for cell volume and turgor regulation, is the principal methyl donor in the methionine cycle and is a DNA and proteins stabilizer. In humans, glycine betaine is synthesized from choline and can be obtained from some foods. Glycine betaine (GB) roles are illustrated in chemical, metabolic, agriculture, and clinical medical studies due to its chemical and physiological properties. Several studies have extensively described GB role and accumulation related to specific pathologies, focusing mainly on analyzing its positive and negative role in these pathologies. However, it is necessary to explain the relationship between glycine betaine and different pathologies concerning its role as an antioxidant, ability to methylate DNA, interact with transcription factors and cell receptors, and participate in the control of homocysteine concentration in liver, kidney and brain. This review summarizes the most important findings and integrates GB role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Furthermore, we discuss GB impact on other dysfunctions as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism, to understand their cross-talks and provide reliable data to establish a base for further investigations.

Homocysteine: overview of biochemistry, molecular biology, and role in disease processes. Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine and plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis in man. Homocysteine levels depend on its synthesis, involving methionine adenosyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases such as glycine N-methyltransferase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; its remethylation to methionine by methionine synthase, which requires methionine synthase reductase, vitamin B (12), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate produced by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or betaine methyltransferase; and its degradation by transsulfuration involving cystathionine beta-synthase. The control of homocysteine metabolism involves changes of tissue content or inherent kinetic properties of the enzymes. In particular, S-adenosylmethionine acts as a switch between remethylation and transsulfuration through its allosteric inhibition of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and activation of cystathionine beta-synthase. Mutant alleles of genes for these enzymes can lead to severe loss of function and varying severity of disease. Several defects lead to severe hyperhomocysteinemia, the most common form being cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, with more than a hundred reported mutations. Less severe elevations of plasma homocysteine are caused by folate and vitamin B (12) deficiency, and renal disease and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with several common disease states such as cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine toxicity is likely direct or caused by disturbed levels of associated metabolites; for example, methylation reactions through elevated S-adenosylhomocysteine.

Young stroke and basal plasma and post-methionine load homocysteine and cysteine levels 1 year after the acute event: do plasma folates make the difference? We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between ischemic stroke in young adults (<45 years of age) and plasma homocysteine (Hcy), plasma folate and vitamin B(12), after a methionine load. We studied 42 patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 29 controls with a negative clinical history of cardio- or cerebrovascular diseases, venous thrombosis and renal disease. A fasting blood sample was drawn from each participant; the second and third samples were collected, respectively, 120 and 240 min after the methionine load. Whilst there was no difference between controls and patients in basal total homocysteine (tHcy), we found a statistically significant difference in both the 120- and 240-min samples. We compared the basal and 240-min tHcy in patients and controls. We obtained a median value of 17.8 and 11.6 micromol/l in patients and controls, respectively. The difference between these two values was highly significant. The methionine loading test (MLT) reveals Hcy metabolism abnormalities that were not revealed by the basal sample. MLT may help identify and treat this new risk factor, which seems to be both atherogenic and prothrombotic, and is hypothesized to operate through various mechanisms.

Methionine restriction delays aging-related urogenital diseases in male Fischer 344 rats. Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been found to enhance longevity across many species. We hypothesized that MR might enhance longevity in part by delaying or inhibiting age-related disease processes. To this end, male Fischer 344 rats were fed control (CF, 0.86% methionine) or MR (0.17% methionine) diets throughout their life until sacrifice at approximately 30 months of age, and histopathology was performed to identify the incidence and progression of two important aging-related pathologies, namely, chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) and testicular tumorigenesis. Although kidney pathology was observed in 87% CF rats and CPN in 62% of CF animals, no evidence of kidney disease was observed in MR rats. Consistent with the absence of renal pathology, urinary albumin levels were lower in the MR group compared to controls throughout the study, with over a six-fold difference between the groups at 30 months of age. Biomarkers associated with renal disease, namely, clusterin, cystatin C, and beta-2 microglobulin, were reduced following 18 months of MR. A reduction in testicular tumor incidence from 88% in CF to 22% in MR rats was also observed. These results suggest that MR may lead to metabolic and cellular changes providing protection against age-related diseases.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's disease. This implies that renal impairment may be a risk factor for AD.
2. **Vascular Compromise and Alzheimer's Disease**: The second abstract highlights the role of cerebrovasculature and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in the development and progression of AD. Vascular compromise, including diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease, can lead to subclinical BBB breakdown, which may contribute to AD.
3. **Homocysteine and Vascular Disease**: The abstracts on homocysteine (e.g., "Homocysteine: overview of biochemistry, molecular biology, and role in disease processes") suggest that elevated homocysteine levels are associated with vascular disease, including cardiovascular disease and stroke, which are risk factors for AD.
4. **Methionine and Homocysteine Metabolism**: The abstract "Methionine restriction delays aging-related urogenital diseases in male Fischer 344 rats" implies that methionine restriction can delay age-related diseases, including renal disease. Methionine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in homocysteine metabolism.
5. **F3 Gene and Coagulation**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, the F3 gene (also known as the tissue factor gene) is involved in coagulation. Tissue factor is a key initiator of the coagulation cascade, and its expression is influenced by various factors, including homocysteine.
6. **Indirect Link between F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease**: Considering the above points, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the following pathway:
	* The F3 wt Allele influences coagulation and vascular function, potentially leading to vascular compromise.
	* Vascular compromise, in turn, contributes to renal impairment and increased homocysteine levels.
	* Elevated homocysteine levels exacerbate vascular disease, including cardiovascular disease and stroke, which are risk factors for AD.
	* Renal impairment and vascular disease can lead to subclinical BBB breakdown, ultimately contributing to the development and progression of AD.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve a complex interplay between coagulation, vascular function, renal impairment, homocysteine metabolism, and BBB dysfunction. However, it is essential to note that this narrative is speculative and based on the provided abstracts, which do not directly investigate the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD. Further research is necessary to confirm this potential link.

Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate in Alzheimer's disease. Renal disease is increasingly regarded as an independent risk factor for vascular disease which in itself is believed to influence risk of AD. ) may represent another potential role for variation in renal function leading to increased risk of AD. We sought to examine estimates of glomerular filtration rate in AD and control groups. AD patients were randomly recruited from the Memory Clinic of the Belfast City Hospital (n = 83). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leucocytes and was genotyped for Apolipoprotein E using standard methods. Using creatinine values, age and gender, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (eGFR) were calculated using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation (using the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UKNEQAS) correction factor). IDMS eGFR values were then compared between AD and control groups. 4 carriage were noted between cases and controls. The AD group had a significantly lower eGFR versus controls (69 vs 77 ml/min) which persisted after adjustment for possible confounders (p = 0.045). This case-control analysis suggests that using a relatively accurate estimate of renal function, patients with AD have greater renal impairment than cognitively normal controls. or be a marker of shared vascular processes altering cerebral and renal functioning.

Breakdown of the Cerebrovasculature and Blood-Brain Barrier: A Mechanistic Link Between Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are among the most pervasive and devastating disorders that afflict people throughout the world. Although typically associated with older demographics, recent epidemiologic studies have reported parallel trends in decreasing age of onset and increasing incidence of these conditions. Promising research continues to implicate the cerebrovasculature and blood-brain barrier (BBB) as playing key roles in AD pathoetiology. Similarly, complications accompanying DM, such as diabetic nephropathy/retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, have been rooted in vascular compromise. Not surprisingly, DM is now considered a major risk factor for AD. The purpose of this review is to highlight investigations into the role of the cerebrovasculature in the development and progression of AD. We give particular attention to studies on humans and a variety of animal model systems that have demonstrated a link between BBB dysfunction and pathological changes in the brain consistent with aging and AD. Together, these studies suggest that the vascular complications associated with chronic, poorly managed DM can lead to subclinical BBB breakdown that precedes and drives the pathological changes progressing to symptomatic AD, providing a common mechanistic thread connecting these two disorders. Furthermore, this emphasizes the need to focus on the vasculature as a potential therapeutic target with the intent of limiting BBB breakdown involved in disease initiation and progression. In conclusion, AD may be more than just an associated comorbidity of DM, and instead another manifestation of the underlying vascular pathology that is common to both.

The probable involvement of soluble and deposited melanins, their intermediates and the reactive oxygen side-products in human diseases and aging. The plasma soluble melanins (PSM) form spontaneously in vitro and in vivo and their formation involves oxidative polymerization and copolymerization of dopa, catecholamines, homogentisic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, p-aminophenol, p-phenylenediamine, and other end(ex)ogenous ortho and para polyhydroxy-, (poly)hydroxy(poly)amino- and polyamino-phenyl compounds. The build up of PSM is visible within 2-3 h after the start of incubation at 37 degrees C with 1 mg/ml of plasma. PSM also form similarly in blood and these processes cause hemolysis. The mean quantity of PSM in normal human plasma is 1.61+/-0.1 (S.D.) mg/ml (n = 20) and in normal human urine is 1.1+/-1.2 g/24 h collection (n = 8). They contribute to the yellow color of plasma and urine. Antioxidants delay the formation of PSM. The deposited melanins also form from these precursors. Reactive oxygen side products (ROSP) are generated during and after melanogenesis. Melanins in vivo are generally associated with proteins or with proteins and lipids. The PSM-protein-lipid complexes are called plasma soluble lipofuscins (PSL), because they have histochemical and fluorescence properties similar to those of solid lipofuscins. The soluble and deposited melanins (SDM) and their intermediates have similar toxic chemical reactivities. The oxidizing quinoid (they can produce partially and completely substituted conjugates) and the semiquinoid free radical intermediates are also moieties in most human melanin structures. Soluble melanins formed from dopa, or dopamine, or norepinephrine in weak alkaline solution have been shown to be toxic to human CD4+ lymphoblastic cells (MT-2) at higher than 10 microg/ml concentrations. Alkaptonuria with high levels of homogentisic acid in the plasma is a potentially fatal disease, exhibiting the toxic effects of the homogentisic acid melanin (soluble and deposited), its intermediates and the ROSP. Patients with alkaptonuria develop arthritis and often suffer from other diseases too, including cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death) and kidney disease. Pheochromocytoma, with high levels of catecholamines in the plasma is another potentially fatal disease. The catecholamine PSM of pheochromocytoma have very light yellow or practically no colors, due to the concentrations and chemical structures. Pheochromocytomas can cause hypertension, cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death), kidney disease, stroke, cancer, amyloid formation and can mimic many other diseases, including acute pancreatitis, carcinoid, neuroblastoma, psychiatric illness, hypercalcemia, retinal vascular lesions, and diabetes mellitus. Pheochromocytoma is potentially fatal even in patients without hypertension. Following trauma and surgery, heavily pigmented eyes are apt to experience greater inflammation than lightly pigmented eyes. In Parkinson's disease those neurons are lost first in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus which contain the greatest amounts of neuromelanins. The antihypertensive alphamethyldopa causes Parkinson's syndrome. It forms PSM in a short time in vitro. The side effects of L-dopa (immobility episodes alternate with normal or involuntary movements; psychotic abnormalities) suggest that the SDM, their intermediates and the ROSP present naturally in vivo are involved in the cause of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. There is a large overlap between these two diseases. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation on eye lens protein by rutin. Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) plays a key role in the several pathophysiologies associated with ageing and diabetes, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, chronic renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's disease, nephropathy, neuropathy and cataract. This raises the possibility of inhibition of AGE formation as one of the approaches to prevent or arrest the progression of diabetic complications. Previously, we have reported that some common dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices have the potential to inhibit AGE formation. Flavonoids are abundantly found in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and rutin is one of the commonly found dietary flavonols. In the present study, we have demonstrated the antiglycating potential and mechanism of action of rutin using goat eye lens proteins as model proteins. Under in vitro conditions, rutin inhibited glycation as assessed by SDS-PAGE, AGE-fluorescence, boronate affinity chromatography and immunodetection of specific AGE. Further, we provided insight into the mechanism of inhibition of protein glycation that rutin not only scavenges free-radicals directly but also chelates the metal ions by forming complexes with them and thereby partly inhibiting post-Amadori formation. These findings indicate the potential of rutin to prevent and/or inhibit protein glycation and the prospects for controlling AGE-mediated diabetic pathological conditions in vivo.

Altered uric acid levels and disease states. Altered serum uric acid concentrations, both above and below normal levels, have been linked to a number of disease states. An abnormally high uric acid level has been correlated with gout, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, whereas a reduced uric acid concentration has been linked to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and optic neuritis. Historically, uric acid has been considered a marker of these disease states. Recent studies, however, have provided evidence that uric acid may actually play a role in the development or progression of such diseases. As a result, the manipulation of uric acid concentrations is now either included in, or being investigated for, the treatment of a variety of disease states.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 in a family with diabetes and mild kidney disease diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. Exome sequencing is being increasingly used to identify disease-associated gene mutations. We used whole exome sequencing to determine the genetic basis of a syndrome of diabetes and renal disease affecting a mother and her son. We identified a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-b (HNF1B) gene that encoded a methionine to valine amino acid change (M160V) in the HNF1B protein. This leads us to the previously unappreciated diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and provided a basis for genetic counselling of other family members.

The glycine betaine role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases: Insights into disease and dysfunction networks. Glycine betaine (N, N, N-trimethyl amine) is an osmolyte accumulated in cells that is key for cell volume and turgor regulation, is the principal methyl donor in the methionine cycle and is a DNA and proteins stabilizer. In humans, glycine betaine is synthesized from choline and can be obtained from some foods. Glycine betaine (GB) roles are illustrated in chemical, metabolic, agriculture, and clinical medical studies due to its chemical and physiological properties. Several studies have extensively described GB role and accumulation related to specific pathologies, focusing mainly on analyzing its positive and negative role in these pathologies. However, it is necessary to explain the relationship between glycine betaine and different pathologies concerning its role as an antioxidant, ability to methylate DNA, interact with transcription factors and cell receptors, and participate in the control of homocysteine concentration in liver, kidney and brain. This review summarizes the most important findings and integrates GB role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Furthermore, we discuss GB impact on other dysfunctions as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism, to understand their cross-talks and provide reliable data to establish a base for further investigations.

Homocysteine: overview of biochemistry, molecular biology, and role in disease processes. Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine and plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis in man. Homocysteine levels depend on its synthesis, involving methionine adenosyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases such as glycine N-methyltransferase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; its remethylation to methionine by methionine synthase, which requires methionine synthase reductase, vitamin B (12), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate produced by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or betaine methyltransferase; and its degradation by transsulfuration involving cystathionine beta-synthase. The control of homocysteine metabolism involves changes of tissue content or inherent kinetic properties of the enzymes. In particular, S-adenosylmethionine acts as a switch between remethylation and transsulfuration through its allosteric inhibition of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and activation of cystathionine beta-synthase. Mutant alleles of genes for these enzymes can lead to severe loss of function and varying severity of disease. Several defects lead to severe hyperhomocysteinemia, the most common form being cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, with more than a hundred reported mutations. Less severe elevations of plasma homocysteine are caused by folate and vitamin B (12) deficiency, and renal disease and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with several common disease states such as cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine toxicity is likely direct or caused by disturbed levels of associated metabolites; for example, methylation reactions through elevated S-adenosylhomocysteine.

Young stroke and basal plasma and post-methionine load homocysteine and cysteine levels 1 year after the acute event: do plasma folates make the difference? We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between ischemic stroke in young adults (<45 years of age) and plasma homocysteine (Hcy), plasma folate and vitamin B(12), after a methionine load. We studied 42 patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 29 controls with a negative clinical history of cardio- or cerebrovascular diseases, venous thrombosis and renal disease. A fasting blood sample was drawn from each participant; the second and third samples were collected, respectively, 120 and 240 min after the methionine load. Whilst there was no difference between controls and patients in basal total homocysteine (tHcy), we found a statistically significant difference in both the 120- and 240-min samples. We compared the basal and 240-min tHcy in patients and controls. We obtained a median value of 17.8 and 11.6 micromol/l in patients and controls, respectively. The difference between these two values was highly significant. The methionine loading test (MLT) reveals Hcy metabolism abnormalities that were not revealed by the basal sample. MLT may help identify and treat this new risk factor, which seems to be both atherogenic and prothrombotic, and is hypothesized to operate through various mechanisms.

Methionine restriction delays aging-related urogenital diseases in male Fischer 344 rats. Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been found to enhance longevity across many species. We hypothesized that MR might enhance longevity in part by delaying or inhibiting age-related disease processes. To this end, male Fischer 344 rats were fed control (CF, 0.86% methionine) or MR (0.17% methionine) diets throughout their life until sacrifice at approximately 30 months of age, and histopathology was performed to identify the incidence and progression of two important aging-related pathologies, namely, chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) and testicular tumorigenesis. Although kidney pathology was observed in 87% CF rats and CPN in 62% of CF animals, no evidence of kidney disease was observed in MR rats. Consistent with the absence of renal pathology, urinary albumin levels were lower in the MR group compared to controls throughout the study, with over a six-fold difference between the groups at 30 months of age. Biomarkers associated with renal disease, namely, clusterin, cystatin C, and beta-2 microglobulin, were reduced following 18 months of MR. A reduction in testicular tumor incidence from 88% in CF to 22% in MR rats was also observed. These results suggest that MR may lead to metabolic and cellular changes providing protection against age-related diseases.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Vascular Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's disease, implying a link between renal function and AD. Vascular disease, which is influenced by renal function, is also a known risk factor for AD.
2. **Vascular Compromise and Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Breakdown**: The second abstract highlights the role of vascular compromise in the development and progression of AD. The breakdown of the BBB, which can be caused by vascular complications, is thought to precede and drive the pathological changes leading to symptomatic AD.
3. **Oxidative Stress and Inflammation**: The third abstract discusses the involvement of soluble and deposited melanins, their intermediates, and reactive oxygen side-products in human diseases, including Alzheimer's. Oxidative stress and inflammation, which are associated with melanin formation, may contribute to the development of AD.
4. **Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGEs) and Oxidative Stress**: The fourth abstract mentions the role of AGEs in several pathophysiologies, including Alzheimer's disease. AGEs can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, which may contribute to the development of AD.
5. **Uric Acid and Oxidative Stress**: The fifth abstract notes that altered uric acid levels are associated with various disease states, including Alzheimer's. Uric acid can act as an antioxidant, but elevated levels may also contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation.
6. **Homocysteine and Vascular Disease**: The sixth and seventh abstracts discuss the role of homocysteine in vascular disease and thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a known risk factor for AD.
7. **Glycine Betaine and Methylation**: The eighth abstract mentions the role of glycine betaine in methylation processes and its potential impact on various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like AD.
8. **Methionine Restriction and Aging-Related Diseases**: The ninth abstract suggests that methionine restriction may delay aging-related diseases, including chronic progressive nephropathy and testicular tumorigenesis. Methionine is an amino acid involved in homocysteine metabolism, and its restriction may have implications for AD risk.
9. **Homocysteine and Tissue Factor Activity**: The tenth abstract notes that homocysteine can induce tissue factor activity in endothelial cells, leading to coagulation and thrombosis. This process may contribute to the development of vascular disease and, indirectly, AD.

Connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be:

* The F3 wt Allele may influence renal function, which is associated with vascular disease and, in turn, AD risk.
* Vascular compromise and BBB breakdown, which are linked to AD, may be influenced by factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and AGEs.
* Homocysteine, which is involved in vascular disease and thrombosis, may be influenced by methionine metabolism and glycine betaine.
* Uric acid, which has antioxidant properties, may also contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially influencing AD risk.
* Methionine restriction, which may delay aging-related diseases, could have implications for AD risk by influencing homocysteine metabolism and vascular health.

While this narrative provides a possible indirect link between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease, it is essential to note that the relationships between these entities are complex and influenced by multiple factors. Further research is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and to determine the significance of the F3 wt Allele in AD risk.

The plasma soluble melanins (PSM) form spontaneously in vitro and in vivo and their formation involves oxidative polymerization and copolymerization of dopa, catecholamines, homogentisic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, p-aminophenol, p-phenylenediamine, and other end(ex)ogenous ortho and para polyhydroxy-, (poly)hydroxy(poly)amino- and polyamino-phenyl compounds. The build up of PSM is visible within 2-3 h after the start of incubation at 37 degrees C with 1 mg/ml of plasma. PSM also form similarly in blood and these processes cause hemolysis. The mean quantity of PSM in normal human plasma is 1.61+/-0.1 (S.D.) mg/ml (n = 20) and in normal human urine is 1.1+/-1.2 g/24 h collection (n = 8). They contribute to the yellow color of plasma and urine. Antioxidants delay the formation of PSM. The deposited melanins also form from these precursors. Reactive oxygen side products (ROSP) are generated during and after melanogenesis. Melanins in vivo are generally associated with proteins or with proteins and lipids. The PSM-protein-lipid complexes are called plasma soluble lipofuscins (PSL), because they have histochemical and fluorescence properties similar to those of solid lipofuscins. The soluble and deposited melanins (SDM) and their intermediates have similar toxic chemical reactivities. The oxidizing quinoid (they can produce partially and completely substituted conjugates) and the semiquinoid free radical intermediates are also moieties in most human melanin structures. Soluble melanins formed from dopa, or dopamine, or norepinephrine in weak alkaline solution have been shown to be toxic to human CD4+ lymphoblastic cells (MT-2) at higher than 10 microg/ml concentrations. Alkaptonuria with high levels of homogentisic acid in the plasma is a potentially fatal disease, exhibiting the toxic effects of the homogentisic acid melanin (soluble and deposited), its intermediates and the ROSP. Patients with alkaptonuria develop arthritis and often suffer from other diseases too, including cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death) and kidney disease. Pheochromocytoma, with high levels of catecholamines in the plasma is another potentially fatal disease. The catecholamine PSM of pheochromocytoma have very light yellow or practically no colors, due to the concentrations and chemical structures. Pheochromocytomas can cause hypertension, cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death), kidney disease, stroke, cancer, amyloid formation and can mimic many other diseases, including acute pancreatitis, carcinoid, neuroblastoma, psychiatric illness, hypercalcemia, retinal vascular lesions, and diabetes mellitus. Pheochromocytoma is potentially fatal even in patients without hypertension. Following trauma and surgery, heavily pigmented eyes are apt to experience greater inflammation than lightly pigmented eyes. In Parkinson's disease those neurons are lost first in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus which contain the greatest amounts of neuromelanins. The antihypertensive alphamethyldopa causes Parkinson's syndrome. It forms PSM in a short time in vitro. The side effects of L-dopa (immobility episodes alternate with normal or involuntary movements; psychotic abnormalities) suggest that the SDM, their intermediates and the ROSP present naturally in vivo are involved in the cause of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. There is a large overlap between these two diseases. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation on eye lens protein by rutin. Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) plays a key role in the several pathophysiologies associated with ageing and diabetes, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, chronic renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's disease, nephropathy, neuropathy and cataract. This raises the possibility of inhibition of AGE formation as one of the approaches to prevent or arrest the progression of diabetic complications. Previously, we have reported that some common dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices have the potential to inhibit AGE formation. Flavonoids are abundantly found in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and rutin is one of the commonly found dietary flavonols. In the present study, we have demonstrated the antiglycating potential and mechanism of action of rutin using goat eye lens proteins as model proteins. Under in vitro conditions, rutin inhibited glycation as assessed by SDS-PAGE, AGE-fluorescence, boronate affinity chromatography and immunodetection of specific AGE. Further, we provided insight into the mechanism of inhibition of protein glycation that rutin not only scavenges free-radicals directly but also chelates the metal ions by forming complexes with them and thereby partly inhibiting post-Amadori formation. These findings indicate the potential of rutin to prevent and/or inhibit protein glycation and the prospects for controlling AGE-mediated diabetic pathological conditions in vivo.

Altered uric acid levels and disease states. Altered serum uric acid concentrations, both above and below normal levels, have been linked to a number of disease states. An abnormally high uric acid level has been correlated with gout, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, whereas a reduced uric acid concentration has been linked to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and optic neuritis. Historically, uric acid has been considered a marker of these disease states. Recent studies, however, have provided evidence that uric acid may actually play a role in the development or progression of such diseases. As a result, the manipulation of uric acid concentrations is now either included in, or being investigated for, the treatment of a variety of disease states.

Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Nutritional Aspects. Blood glucose homeostasis is well maintained by coordinated control of various hormones including insulin and glucagon as well as cytokines under normal conditions. However, chronic exposure to diabetic environment with high fat/high sugar diets and physical/mental stress can cause hyperglycemia, one of main characteristics of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Hyperglycemia impairs organogenesis and induces organ abnormalities such as cardiac defect in utero. It is a risk factor for the development of metabolic diseases in adults. Resulting glucotoxicity affects peripheral tissues and vessels, causing pathological complications including diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, vessel damage, and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, chronic exposure to hyperglycemia can deteriorate cognitive function and other aspects of mental health. Recent reports have demonstrated that hyperglycemia is closely related to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting that there may be a cause-effect relationship between hyperglycemia and dementia. With increasing interests in aging-related diseases and mental health, diabetes-related cognitive impairment is attracting great attention. It has been speculated that glucotoxicity can result in structural damage and functional impairment of brain cells and nerves, hemorrhage of cerebral blood vessel, and increased accumulation of amyloid beta. These are potential mechanisms underlying diabetes-related dementia. Nutrients and natural food components have been investigated as preventive and/or intervention strategy. Among candidate components, resveratrol, curcumin, and their analogues might be beneficial for the prevention of diabetes-related cognitive impairment. The purposes of this review are to discuss recent experimental evidence regarding diabetes and cognitive impairment and to suggest potential nutritional intervention strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes-related dementia.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 in a family with diabetes and mild kidney disease diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. Exome sequencing is being increasingly used to identify disease-associated gene mutations. We used whole exome sequencing to determine the genetic basis of a syndrome of diabetes and renal disease affecting a mother and her son. We identified a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-b (HNF1B) gene that encoded a methionine to valine amino acid change (M160V) in the HNF1B protein. This leads us to the previously unappreciated diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and provided a basis for genetic counselling of other family members.

The glycine betaine role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases: Insights into disease and dysfunction networks. Glycine betaine (N, N, N-trimethyl amine) is an osmolyte accumulated in cells that is key for cell volume and turgor regulation, is the principal methyl donor in the methionine cycle and is a DNA and proteins stabilizer. In humans, glycine betaine is synthesized from choline and can be obtained from some foods. Glycine betaine (GB) roles are illustrated in chemical, metabolic, agriculture, and clinical medical studies due to its chemical and physiological properties. Several studies have extensively described GB role and accumulation related to specific pathologies, focusing mainly on analyzing its positive and negative role in these pathologies. However, it is necessary to explain the relationship between glycine betaine and different pathologies concerning its role as an antioxidant, ability to methylate DNA, interact with transcription factors and cell receptors, and participate in the control of homocysteine concentration in liver, kidney and brain. This review summarizes the most important findings and integrates GB role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Furthermore, we discuss GB impact on other dysfunctions as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism, to understand their cross-talks and provide reliable data to establish a base for further investigations.

Homocysteine: overview of biochemistry, molecular biology, and role in disease processes. Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine and plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis in man. Homocysteine levels depend on its synthesis, involving methionine adenosyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases such as glycine N-methyltransferase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; its remethylation to methionine by methionine synthase, which requires methionine synthase reductase, vitamin B (12), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate produced by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or betaine methyltransferase; and its degradation by transsulfuration involving cystathionine beta-synthase. The control of homocysteine metabolism involves changes of tissue content or inherent kinetic properties of the enzymes. In particular, S-adenosylmethionine acts as a switch between remethylation and transsulfuration through its allosteric inhibition of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and activation of cystathionine beta-synthase. Mutant alleles of genes for these enzymes can lead to severe loss of function and varying severity of disease. Several defects lead to severe hyperhomocysteinemia, the most common form being cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, with more than a hundred reported mutations. Less severe elevations of plasma homocysteine are caused by folate and vitamin B (12) deficiency, and renal disease and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with several common disease states such as cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine toxicity is likely direct or caused by disturbed levels of associated metabolites; for example, methylation reactions through elevated S-adenosylhomocysteine.

Young stroke and basal plasma and post-methionine load homocysteine and cysteine levels 1 year after the acute event: do plasma folates make the difference? We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between ischemic stroke in young adults (<45 years of age) and plasma homocysteine (Hcy), plasma folate and vitamin B(12), after a methionine load. We studied 42 patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 29 controls with a negative clinical history of cardio- or cerebrovascular diseases, venous thrombosis and renal disease. A fasting blood sample was drawn from each participant; the second and third samples were collected, respectively, 120 and 240 min after the methionine load. Whilst there was no difference between controls and patients in basal total homocysteine (tHcy), we found a statistically significant difference in both the 120- and 240-min samples. We compared the basal and 240-min tHcy in patients and controls. We obtained a median value of 17.8 and 11.6 micromol/l in patients and controls, respectively. The difference between these two values was highly significant. The methionine loading test (MLT) reveals Hcy metabolism abnormalities that were not revealed by the basal sample. MLT may help identify and treat this new risk factor, which seems to be both atherogenic and prothrombotic, and is hypothesized to operate through various mechanisms.

Methionine restriction delays aging-related urogenital diseases in male Fischer 344 rats. Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been found to enhance longevity across many species. We hypothesized that MR might enhance longevity in part by delaying or inhibiting age-related disease processes. To this end, male Fischer 344 rats were fed control (CF, 0.86% methionine) or MR (0.17% methionine) diets throughout their life until sacrifice at approximately 30 months of age, and histopathology was performed to identify the incidence and progression of two important aging-related pathologies, namely, chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) and testicular tumorigenesis. Although kidney pathology was observed in 87% CF rats and CPN in 62% of CF animals, no evidence of kidney disease was observed in MR rats. Consistent with the absence of renal pathology, urinary albumin levels were lower in the MR group compared to controls throughout the study, with over a six-fold difference between the groups at 30 months of age. Biomarkers associated with renal disease, namely, clusterin, cystatin C, and beta-2 microglobulin, were reduced following 18 months of MR. A reduction in testicular tumor incidence from 88% in CF to 22% in MR rats was also observed. These results suggest that MR may lead to metabolic and cellular changes providing protection against age-related diseases.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

Current status of closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus. Closed circuit diving systems are certainly not a new concept, but advanced technology is turning the concept into practical reality. For years the development of these systems has stagnated in their classified covert operations role, but a new group of sophisticated divers--scientists, photographers and technical divers--has emerged to spur the commercial development of closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus. The traditional silent and bubble-free capability is being augmented with such additions as microprocessor usage, dependable oxygen sensing, carbon dioxide sensing, and PC integration.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's Disease, implying a link between renal function and AD. This connection could be mediated by vascular disease, which is a known risk factor for AD.

2. **Homocysteine and Vascular Disease**: Elevated homocysteine levels are a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, as mentioned in several abstracts. Homocysteine can induce tissue factor activity in endothelial cells, contributing to coagulation and vascular disease.

3. **F3 Gene and Homocysteine**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided abstracts, the F3 gene (also known as the factor III or tissue factor gene) plays a crucial role in coagulation. Variants of the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence homocysteine levels or its effects on vascular disease. For example, if the F3 wt Allele affects tissue factor expression or activity, it could modulate the pro-coagulant effects of homocysteine.

4. **Vascular Disease and Alzheimer's Disease**: Vascular disease is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease. The connection between homocysteine, vascular disease, and AD could be mediated by the F3 gene, which influences coagulation and, subsequently, vascular health.

5. **Additional Intermediate Factors**: Other factors, such as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), oxidative stress, and inflammation, might also contribute to the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease. For example, AGEs can accumulate in vascular tissues and contribute to vascular disease, which is a risk factor for AD.

6. **Nutritional and Environmental Factors**: The abstracts also highlight the importance of nutritional and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and exposure to toxins, in modulating the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease. For instance, a diet rich in antioxidants and flavonoids, such as rutin, might help mitigate the effects of homocysteine and vascular disease on AD risk.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve a complex interplay of factors, including:

* Renal function and vascular disease
* Homocysteine and its effects on coagulation and vascular disease
* The F3 gene and its influence on tissue factor expression and activity
* Additional intermediate factors, such as AGEs, oxidative stress, and inflammation
* Nutritional and environmental factors, such as diet and physical activity

While the provided abstracts do not directly link the F3 wt Allele to Alzheimer's Disease, they suggest a possible narrative that involves multiple intermediate entities and processes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD.

Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate in Alzheimer's disease. Renal disease is increasingly regarded as an independent risk factor for vascular disease which in itself is believed to influence risk of AD. ) may represent another potential role for variation in renal function leading to increased risk of AD. We sought to examine estimates of glomerular filtration rate in AD and control groups. AD patients were randomly recruited from the Memory Clinic of the Belfast City Hospital (n = 83). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leucocytes and was genotyped for Apolipoprotein E using standard methods. Using creatinine values, age and gender, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (eGFR) were calculated using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation (using the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UKNEQAS) correction factor). IDMS eGFR values were then compared between AD and control groups. 4 carriage were noted between cases and controls. The AD group had a significantly lower eGFR versus controls (69 vs 77 ml/min) which persisted after adjustment for possible confounders (p = 0.045). This case-control analysis suggests that using a relatively accurate estimate of renal function, patients with AD have greater renal impairment than cognitively normal controls. or be a marker of shared vascular processes altering cerebral and renal functioning.

The probable involvement of soluble and deposited melanins, their intermediates and the reactive oxygen side-products in human diseases and aging. The plasma soluble melanins (PSM) form spontaneously in vitro and in vivo and their formation involves oxidative polymerization and copolymerization of dopa, catecholamines, homogentisic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, p-aminophenol, p-phenylenediamine, and other end(ex)ogenous ortho and para polyhydroxy-, (poly)hydroxy(poly)amino- and polyamino-phenyl compounds. The build up of PSM is visible within 2-3 h after the start of incubation at 37 degrees C with 1 mg/ml of plasma. PSM also form similarly in blood and these processes cause hemolysis. The mean quantity of PSM in normal human plasma is 1.61+/-0.1 (S.D.) mg/ml (n = 20) and in normal human urine is 1.1+/-1.2 g/24 h collection (n = 8). They contribute to the yellow color of plasma and urine. Antioxidants delay the formation of PSM. The deposited melanins also form from these precursors. Reactive oxygen side products (ROSP) are generated during and after melanogenesis. Melanins in vivo are generally associated with proteins or with proteins and lipids. The PSM-protein-lipid complexes are called plasma soluble lipofuscins (PSL), because they have histochemical and fluorescence properties similar to those of solid lipofuscins. The soluble and deposited melanins (SDM) and their intermediates have similar toxic chemical reactivities. The oxidizing quinoid (they can produce partially and completely substituted conjugates) and the semiquinoid free radical intermediates are also moieties in most human melanin structures. Soluble melanins formed from dopa, or dopamine, or norepinephrine in weak alkaline solution have been shown to be toxic to human CD4+ lymphoblastic cells (MT-2) at higher than 10 microg/ml concentrations. Alkaptonuria with high levels of homogentisic acid in the plasma is a potentially fatal disease, exhibiting the toxic effects of the homogentisic acid melanin (soluble and deposited), its intermediates and the ROSP. Patients with alkaptonuria develop arthritis and often suffer from other diseases too, including cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death) and kidney disease. Pheochromocytoma, with high levels of catecholamines in the plasma is another potentially fatal disease. The catecholamine PSM of pheochromocytoma have very light yellow or practically no colors, due to the concentrations and chemical structures. Pheochromocytomas can cause hypertension, cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death), kidney disease, stroke, cancer, amyloid formation and can mimic many other diseases, including acute pancreatitis, carcinoid, neuroblastoma, psychiatric illness, hypercalcemia, retinal vascular lesions, and diabetes mellitus. Pheochromocytoma is potentially fatal even in patients without hypertension. Following trauma and surgery, heavily pigmented eyes are apt to experience greater inflammation than lightly pigmented eyes. In Parkinson's disease those neurons are lost first in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus which contain the greatest amounts of neuromelanins. The antihypertensive alphamethyldopa causes Parkinson's syndrome. It forms PSM in a short time in vitro. The side effects of L-dopa (immobility episodes alternate with normal or involuntary movements; psychotic abnormalities) suggest that the SDM, their intermediates and the ROSP present naturally in vivo are involved in the cause of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. There is a large overlap between these two diseases. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Inhibition of advanced glycation end-product formation on eye lens protein by rutin. Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) plays a key role in the several pathophysiologies associated with ageing and diabetes, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, chronic renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's disease, nephropathy, neuropathy and cataract. This raises the possibility of inhibition of AGE formation as one of the approaches to prevent or arrest the progression of diabetic complications. Previously, we have reported that some common dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices have the potential to inhibit AGE formation. Flavonoids are abundantly found in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and rutin is one of the commonly found dietary flavonols. In the present study, we have demonstrated the antiglycating potential and mechanism of action of rutin using goat eye lens proteins as model proteins. Under in vitro conditions, rutin inhibited glycation as assessed by SDS-PAGE, AGE-fluorescence, boronate affinity chromatography and immunodetection of specific AGE. Further, we provided insight into the mechanism of inhibition of protein glycation that rutin not only scavenges free-radicals directly but also chelates the metal ions by forming complexes with them and thereby partly inhibiting post-Amadori formation. These findings indicate the potential of rutin to prevent and/or inhibit protein glycation and the prospects for controlling AGE-mediated diabetic pathological conditions in vivo.

Altered uric acid levels and disease states. Altered serum uric acid concentrations, both above and below normal levels, have been linked to a number of disease states. An abnormally high uric acid level has been correlated with gout, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, whereas a reduced uric acid concentration has been linked to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and optic neuritis. Historically, uric acid has been considered a marker of these disease states.

Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Nutritional Aspects. Blood glucose homeostasis is well maintained by coordinated control of various hormones including insulin and glucagon as well as cytokines under normal conditions. However, chronic exposure to diabetic environment with high fat/high sugar diets and physical/mental stress can cause hyperglycemia, one of main characteristics of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Hyperglycemia impairs organogenesis and induces organ abnormalities such as cardiac defect in utero. It is a risk factor for the development of metabolic diseases in adults. Resulting glucotoxicity affects peripheral tissues and vessels, causing pathological complications including diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, vessel damage, and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, chronic exposure to hyperglycemia can deteriorate cognitive function and other aspects of mental health. Recent reports have demonstrated that hyperglycemia is closely related to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting that there may be a cause-effect relationship between hyperglycemia and dementia. With increasing interests in aging-related diseases and mental health, diabetes-related cognitive impairment is attracting great attention. It has been speculated that glucotoxicity can result in structural damage and functional impairment of brain cells and nerves, hemorrhage of cerebral blood vessel, and increased accumulation of amyloid beta. These are potential mechanisms underlying diabetes-related dementia. Nutrients and natural food components have been investigated as preventive and/or intervention strategy. Among candidate components, resveratrol, curcumin, and their analogues might be beneficial for the prevention of diabetes-related cognitive impairment. The purposes of this review are to discuss recent experimental evidence regarding diabetes and cognitive impairment and to suggest potential nutritional intervention strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes-related dementia.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 in a family with diabetes and mild kidney disease diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. Exome sequencing is being increasingly used to identify disease-associated gene mutations. We used whole exome sequencing to determine the genetic basis of a syndrome of diabetes and renal disease affecting a mother and her son. We identified a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-b (HNF1B) gene that encoded a methionine to valine amino acid change (M160V) in the HNF1B protein. This leads us to the previously unappreciated diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and provided a basis for genetic counselling of other family members.

Homocysteine: overview of biochemistry, molecular biology, and role in disease processes. Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine and plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis in man. Homocysteine levels depend on its synthesis, involving methionine adenosyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases such as glycine N-methyltransferase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; its remethylation to methionine by methionine synthase, which requires methionine synthase reductase, vitamin B (12), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate produced by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or betaine methyltransferase; and its degradation by transsulfuration involving cystathionine beta-synthase.

In particular, S-adenosylmethionine acts as a switch between remethylation and transsulfuration through its allosteric inhibition of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and activation of cystathionine beta-synthase. Mutant alleles of genes for these enzymes can lead to severe loss of function and varying severity of disease. Several defects lead to severe hyperhomocysteinemia, the most common form being cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, with more than a hundred reported mutations. Less severe elevations of plasma homocysteine are caused by folate and vitamin B (12) deficiency, and renal disease and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with several common disease states such as cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine toxicity is likely direct or caused by disturbed levels of associated metabolites; for example, methylation reactions through elevated S-adenosylhomocysteine.

Young stroke and basal plasma and post-methionine load homocysteine and cysteine levels 1 year after the acute event: do plasma folates make the difference? We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between ischemic stroke in young adults (<45 years of age) and plasma homocysteine (Hcy), plasma folate and vitamin B(12), after a methionine load. We studied 42 patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 29 controls with a negative clinical history of cardio- or cerebrovascular diseases, venous thrombosis and renal disease. A fasting blood sample was drawn from each participant; the second and third samples were collected, respectively, 120 and 240 min after the methionine load. Whilst there was no difference between controls and patients in basal total homocysteine (tHcy), we found a statistically significant difference in both the 120- and 240-min samples. We compared the basal and 240-min tHcy in patients and controls. We obtained a median value of 17.8 and 11.6 micromol/l in patients and controls, respectively. The difference between these two values was highly significant. The methionine loading test (MLT) reveals Hcy metabolism abnormalities that were not revealed by the basal sample. MLT may help identify and treat this new risk factor, which seems to be both atherogenic and prothrombotic, and is hypothesized to operate through various mechanisms.

Methionine restriction delays aging-related urogenital diseases in male Fischer 344 rats. Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been found to enhance longevity across many species. We hypothesized that MR might enhance longevity in part by delaying or inhibiting age-related disease processes. To this end, male Fischer 344 rats were fed control (CF, 0.86% methionine) or MR (0.17% methionine) diets throughout their life until sacrifice at approximately 30 months of age, and histopathology was performed to identify the incidence and progression of two important aging-related pathologies, namely, chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) and testicular tumorigenesis. Although kidney pathology was observed in 87% CF rats and CPN in 62% of CF animals, no evidence of kidney disease was observed in MR rats. Consistent with the absence of renal pathology, urinary albumin levels were lower in the MR group compared to controls throughout the study, with over a six-fold difference between the groups at 30 months of age. Biomarkers associated with renal disease, namely, clusterin, cystatin C, and beta-2 microglobulin, were reduced following 18 months of MR. A reduction in testicular tumor incidence from 88% in CF to 22% in MR rats was also observed. These results suggest that MR may lead to metabolic and cellular changes providing protection against age-related diseases.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

10 strategies for successful patient teaching.

Current status of closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus. Closed circuit diving systems are certainly not a new concept, but advanced technology is turning the concept into practical reality. For years the development of these systems has stagnated in their classified covert operations role, but a new group of sophisticated divers--scientists, photographers and technical divers--has emerged to spur the commercial development of closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus. The traditional silent and bubble-free capability is being augmented with such additions as microprocessor usage, dependable oxygen sensing, carbon dioxide sensing, and PC integration.

Urological complications after radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer is naturally associated with a number of urological complications. In a review of 320 hospital records we found a 6.6% incidence of intraoperative injury to the bladder or ureters; in all cases the tumour had encroached on the organ. The incidence of postoperative fistula formation was 4.4%. Postoperative urodynamic studies of 116 patients after radical hysterectomy, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, quantified lower urinary tract dysfunction. A prospective study of 40 patients showed that 20% developed urinary stress-incontinence after surgery. Patients who had had surgery only showed an improvement in most urodynamic parameters over the years, while patients who had also had radiotherapy did not. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients after surgery only were satisfied with their condition and, years later, reported no complaints. They may just have become used to them, but half the patients who had also had radiotherapy reported complaints, mainly impaired bladder sensation, frequency and nocturia. Urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy is inevitable, but meticulous peri-operative management, regular follow-up examinations and psychological support can keep it to a minimum and help the patient to cope.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Renal Function and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract suggests that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with Alzheimer's disease, implying a link between renal function and AD. This connection could be mediated by vascular disease, which is a known risk factor for AD.

2. **Homocysteine and Methionine Metabolism**: The abstracts on homocysteine and methionine restriction highlight the importance of these amino acids in disease processes. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and potentially AD. Methionine restriction has been shown to delay aging-related diseases, including renal disease, in animal models.

3. **Glycine Betaine and Disease**: Glycine betaine, which is involved in methionine metabolism, has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and renal diseases. Its role as an antioxidant, methyl donor, and regulator of homocysteine levels could contribute to the development or progression of AD.

4. **Uric Acid and Disease**: Altered uric acid levels have been linked to several disease states, including AD. Uric acid may play a role in the development or progression of these diseases, and its manipulation is being investigated as a potential treatment.

5. **Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract on diabetes and AD highlights the potential link between hyperglycemia, glucotoxicity, and cognitive impairment. Diabetes-related cognitive impairment may share common mechanisms with AD, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism dysregulation.

6. **F3 wt Allele and Coagulation**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided abstracts, the F3 gene is involved in coagulation, and variations in this gene could potentially influence the risk of thrombotic events, which are associated with AD.

Connecting these elements, a possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be:

* The F3 wt Allele influences coagulation and thrombotic risk, which is associated with cardiovascular disease and renal disease.
* Cardiovascular and renal disease are risk factors for AD, potentially through shared vascular mechanisms or the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as homocysteine.
* Homocysteine and methionine metabolism, which are influenced by glycine betaine and other factors, play a role in the development or progression of AD.
* Uric acid and diabetes-related metabolic dysregulation may also contribute to the development or progression of AD, potentially through inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism dysregulation.

In summary, the F3 wt Allele may indirectly influence the risk of Alzheimer's Disease through its effects on coagulation, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, which are associated with AD through shared vascular mechanisms, toxic metabolites, and metabolic dysregulation. However, this narrative is speculative and requires further research to confirm the relationships between these entities and processes.

Analyzing 54,936 Samples Supports the Association Between CD2AP rs9349407 Polymorphism and Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility. The CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) rs9349407 polymorphism was first identified to be significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in European ancestry by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the following studies reported no association in Chinese, Japanese, African-American, Canadian, and European populations. We think that these negative results may have been caused by either relatively small sample sizes compared with those used for the previous GWAS in European ancestry or the genetic heterogeneity of the rs9349407 polymorphism in different populations. Here, we reevaluated this association using the relatively large-scale samples from 15 previous studies (N = 54,936; 23,777 cases and 31,159 controls) by searching the PubMed, AlzGene, and Google Scholar databases. Using an additive genetic model, we did not identify a significant heterogeneity among the 15 studies. Using meta-analysis, we observed a significant association between the rs9349407 polymorphism and AD with P = 8.78E-07, odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.12. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to investigate the association between rs9349407 polymorphism and AD in East Asian, American, Canadian, and European populations. Our analysis further supports previous findings that the CD2AP rs9349407 polymorphism contributes to AD susceptibility. We believe that our findings will be very useful for future genetic studies on AD.

Genetic perturbations of disease risk genes in mice capture transcriptomic signatures of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. New genetic and genomic resources have identified multiple genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and characterized this common dementia at the molecular level. Experimental studies in model organisms can validate these associations and elucidate the links between specific genetic factors and transcriptomic signatures. Animal models based on LOAD-associated genes can potentially connect common genetic variation with LOAD transcriptomes, thereby providing novel insights into basic biological mechanisms underlying the disease. We performed RNA-Seq on whole brain samples from a panel of six-month-old female mice, each carrying one of the following mutations: homozygous deletions of Apoe and Clu; hemizygous deletions of Bin1 and Cd2ap; and a transgenic APOEepsilon4. Similar data from a transgenic APP/PS1 model was included for comparison to early-onset variant effects. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules of correlated genes and each module was tested for differential expression by strain. We then compared mouse modules with human postmortem brain modules from the Accelerating Medicine's Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) to determine the LOAD-related processes affected by each genetic risk factor. Mouse modules were significantly enriched in multiple AD-related processes, including immune response, inflammation, lipid processing, endocytosis, and synaptic cell function. WGCNA modules were significantly associated with Apoe-/-, APOEepsilon4, Clu-/-, and APP/PS1 mouse models. Apoe-/-, GFAP-driven APOEepsilon4, and APP/PS1 driven modules overlapped with AMP-AD inflammation and microglial modules; Clu-/- driven modules overlapped with synaptic modules; and APP/PS1 modules separately overlapped with lipid-processing and metabolism modules. This study of genetic mouse models provides a basis to dissect the role of AD risk genes in relevant AD pathologies. We determined that different genetic perturbations affect different molecular mechanisms comprising AD, and mapped specific effects to each risk gene. Our approach provides a platform for further exploration into the causes and progression of AD by assessing animal models at different ages and/or with different combinations of LOAD risk variants.

Common variants at ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci reported by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) in a companion paper. We undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated variants with P <= 1 * 10(-5). We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7 (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 * 10(-17); including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 * 10(-21)) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 * 10(-14); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 * 10(-16)) are new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 8.6 * 10(-9)), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 * 10(-9)) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 * 10(-10)).

Genetic factors related to the immune system in subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the cause of dementia. Although the pathomechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease have not been fully elucidated, there is evidence that genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. Immune system changes, both environmentally-induced and, as a result of predisposing genetics, are implicated in Alzheimer's disease etiopathogenesis. Genes associated with immune system dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease include CLU, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7, HLA-DRB1, TREM2, EPHA1, and CD2AP. In particular, BIN1 and CLU, aberrations in which are thought to promote neurodegeneration by dysregulating exocytosis and immune processes, together with the E4 variant of the APOE gene, are among the most common genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. While the relationships between these genes in Alzheimer's disease have been examined, little information exists regarding their role as variables predisposing first or second-degree relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients to the illness. The rationale of this review is to suggest that individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease who have the BIN1-T/T variant may be at significant risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Also, the unfavorable BIN1-T variant is independent of APOE E4-associated risk. People at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease are more often carriers of the protective C-variant of the CLU gene, the presence of which might be associated with later-onset dementia observable within this high-risk group. It seems BIN1 and CLU together with, albeit independent of APOE E4, may be among the factors predisposing individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease to developing the illness.

Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility Genes in Malignant Breast Tumors. Cognitive problems have been reported in breast cancer patients after chemotherapy. A small group of older breast cancer survivors carrying the APOE4 gene, receiving chemotherapy, was at increased risk of long-term impairment of brain function. We have analyzed the expression of APOE and the next 23-ranked Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility genes in malignant breast tumors. We wished to determine if these 24 genes might be related to breast cancer. To identify the most important AD susceptibility genes, we consulted the ALZGENE database (www.alzgene.org/) which displays this information and regularly updates it. To analyze the effect of AD susceptibility genes on breast cancer, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We analyzed TCGA data with cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. cBioPortal provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomic data sets. cBioPortal can analyze APOE in breast tumors but cannot distinguish its three alleles: E2, E3, and E4. About 1.6% of the tumors had APOE amplification (copy number alteration). Two percent of the tumors had CD33 alterations. None of the tumors had APOE mutations. Two tumors had CD33 missense mutations of unknown significance. Expression heatmap shows that over- or underexpression of APOE and CD33 was correlated in most of the tumors. APOE alteration significantly co-occurred with CD33 and CD2AP. Alterations of certain cancer genes tend to co-occur, indicating that they may work in tandem to drive tumor formation and development. This may be the case with the co-occurring alterations of APOE, CD33, and CD2AP. It would be important to know which APOE allele(s) were co-occurrent with CD33 and CD2AP and whether co-occurrence in the tumor predicted increased risk of AD. This information could help in identification of specific risk factors for breast cancer-related cognitive decline in older women, which has important implications for oncology care.

Synaptopodin protects against proteinuria by disrupting Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling complexes in kidney podocytes. The actin-based foot processes of kidney podocytes and the interposed slit diaphragm form the final barrier to proteinuria. Mutations affecting several podocyte proteins cause disruption of the filtration barrier and rearrangement of the highly dynamic podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Proteins regulating the plasticity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton are therefore of critical importance for sustained kidney barrier function. Synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein essential for the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton because synaptopodin-deficient mice display impaired recovery from protamine sulfate-induced foot process effacement and lipopolysaccharide-induced nephrotic syndrome. Moreover, bigenic heterozygosity for synaptopodin and CD2AP is sufficient to induce spontaneous proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-like glomerular damage in mice. Mechanistically, synaptopodin induces stress fibers by blocking the proteasomal degradation of RhoA. Here we show that synaptopodin directly binds to IRSp53 and suppresses Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena-initiated filopodia formation by blocking the binding of Cdc42 and Mena to IRSp53. The Mena inhibitor FP(4)-Mito suppresses aberrant filopodia formation in synaptopodin knockdown podocytes, and when delivered into mice protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced proteinuria. The identification of synaptopodin as an inhibitor of Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling defines a novel antiproteinuric signaling pathway and offers new targets for the development of antiproteinuric therapeutic modalities.

DAPLE orchestrates apical actomyosin assembly from junctional polarity complexes.  Establishment of apicobasal polarity and the organization of the cytoskeleton must operate coordinately to ensure proper epithelial cell shape and function.  However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which polarity complexes directly instruct the cytoskeletal machinery to determine cell shape are poorly understood.  Here, we define a mechanism by which the PAR polarity complex (PAR3-PAR6-aPKC) at apical cell junctions leads to efficient assembly of the apical actomyosin network to maintain epithelial cell morphology.  We found that the PAR polarity complex recruits the protein DAPLE to apical cell junctions, which in turn triggers a two-pronged mechanism that converges upon assembly of apical actomyosin.  More specifically, DAPLE directly recruits the actin-stabilizing protein CD2AP to apical junctions and, concomitantly, activates heterotrimeric G protein signaling in a GPCR-independent manner to favor RhoA-myosin activation.  These observations establish DAPLE as a direct molecular link between junctional polarity complexes and the formation of apical cytoskeletal assemblies that support epithelial cell shape. 

Adrenomedullin ameliorates podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in vitro and in vivo through modulation of Rho GTPases. Podocyte injury is a key event in proteinuric kidney disease and eventually glomerular scarring. While adrenomedullin (AM), a potent vasodilatory peptide, has been reported to confer renoprotection in several experimental models of kidney diseases, its effect on injured podocytes and the related mechanism is still largely unknown. Employing Western blotting analysis, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we investigated the effects of AM on the expressions of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho-family small GTPases (Rho GTPases) in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced podocyte injury, both in cultured podocytes and in PAN nephrosis rats. Urinary protein excretion and the morphologic changes of kidney in PAN nephrosis rats were evaluated. Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay was applied for Rho GTPases activity. PAN induced massive albuminuria and morphologic injury, which were significantly mitigated by AM administration. AM significantly antagonized not only the PAN-decreased expressions of synaptopodin, nephrin, CD2AP and podocin, but also the PAN-disrupted interactions between synaptopodin-RhoA, nephrin-CD2AP, and CD2AP-Rac1-cortactin. These effects of AM in cultured podocytes were mostly significantly blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor. AM dramatically upregulated the PAN-induced Rho GTPases protein expressions and their activities. PAN increased the expressions of endogenous AM and its receptor RAMP2 which was furthermore upregulated by AM administration. AM alleviated podocyte injury induced by PAN both in cell culture and in PAN nephrosis. The beneficial effects of AM on podocytes can be attributable to direct modulation of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho GTPases, mainly via a PKA-dependent pathway.

Terminal care: how can we do better?

Integral role of RhoA activation in monocyte adhesion-triggered tissue factor expression in endothelial cells. The role of Rho activation in the regulation of tissue factor (TF) is not clear. This study was undertaken to investigate this in endothelial cells induced by monocyte adhesion. Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were added to cultured human coronary endothelial cells. Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells increased the levels of TF antigen in the endothelial cells. The results of transient transfection of the human TF promoter/luciferase gene into endothelial cells indicated that the increase in endothelial expression of the TF gene caused by monocyte adhesion occurred at the transcriptional level. The upregulation of TF was inhibited by statins, and the suppressive effect of statins was reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Monocyte adhesion rapidly upregulated the membrane translocation and GTP/GDP exchange of RhoA, but not of Cdc42 or Rac, in endothelial cells. Rho inhibition by C3 exoenzyme or adenovirus-mediated expression of N19RhoA prevented the endothelial upregulation of TF caused by monocyte adhesion, and this was mimicked by Rho-kinase inhibitors. Moreover, monocyte adhesion increased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 in endothelial cells, and this was prevented by statins and Rho inhibition. Our study shows that RhoA activation plays an integral role in TF expression in endothelial cells.

Subcellular localization of tissue factor and human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Tissue factor (TF) is the most relevant physiological trigger of thrombosis. Additionally TF is a transmembrane receptor with cell signaling functions. The aim of this study was to investigate TF subcellular localization, function and signaling in human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Coronary arteries and primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) were obtained from human explanted hearts. Wound repair and Boyden chamber assays were used to measure migration in vitro. TF-pro-coagulant activity (TF-PCA) was measured in extracted cellular membranes. Analysis of TF distribution was performed by confocal microscopy. A nucleofector device was used for TF and protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) silencing. mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. In migrating HVSMC TF translocates to the leading edge of the cells showing an intense patch-like staining in the lamellipodia. In the migrating front TF colocalizes with filamin (FLN) in the polarized lipid rafts. TF-PCA was increased in migrating cells. Silencing of the TF gene inhibits RSK-induced FLN-Ser-2152 phosphorylation, down-regulates CDC42, RhoA, and Rac1 protein expression and significantly inhibits cell migration. Silencing PAR2 also inhibits cell migration; however, silencing both TF and PAR2 induces a significantly higher effect on migration. Smooth muscle cells expressing TF have been identified in non-lipid-rich human coronary artery atherosclerotic plaques. TF translocates to the cell front in association with cytoskeleton proteins and regulates HVSMC migration by mechanisms dependent and independent of factor (F)VIIa/PAR2. These results extend the functional role of TF to smooth muscle cell trafficking in vessel wall remodeling.

Contractual incentives: a threat to evidence-based medicine?

Mechanisms of tolerance in the copper-loaded rat liver. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of copper-induced damage and subsequent recovery and tolerance to copper in the copper-loaded rat liver. Male Wistar rats were allocated randomly into groups of four, fed a pelleted diet containing 1500 mg/g copper, and killed at 1, 5, 6, 10, and 15 weeks. Two additional groups were treated as follows: (a) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks with normal rodent diet (group 5-0), (b) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks normal diet and 5 weeks of copper reloading (group 5-0-5). Control rats were fed a normal rodent diet that contained 18 mg/kg of copper. Tissues were collected for histology, histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and copper analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and X-ray microanalysis. In the rats continuously fed the high copper diet, copper concentration rose to 444 +/- 32 micrograms/g of liver (wet weight) by Week 1 and to 726 +/- 170 micrograms/g at Week 5, decreasing to 417 +/- 9 micrograms/g at Week 15. X-ray microanalysis and dot mapping microanalysis demonstrated copper within the nucleus, nucleolus, and lysosomes of these continuously loaded rats. Recovery with unloading of liver copper was demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative methods in group 5-0 (41.32 +/- 19 micrograms/g). Recovery and tolerance were associated with a reduction in nucleolar copper. Copper tolerance was demonstrated in group 5-0-5 and in continuously copper-loaded rats by Weeks 10 and 15. Copper tolerance was reflected by a change in intracellular levels and distribution of copper and an efficient copper unloading mechanism.

Effects of feeding sows fat or fructose during late gestation and lactation. The effects of dietary fat or fructose supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow milk production and composition and on progeny were examined. On d 88 of gestation, 24 sows were allotted by parity to three dietary treatments (eight sows/treatment). Treatments were 1) a 12.5% crude protein, corn-soybean meal control, 2) the control + 10% added fat or 3) the control + 23% high fructose corn syrup. All treatments were fed to supply 1.82 kg/d of the control diet from d 89 of gestation to parturition with sows in treatments 2 or 3 receiving .18 kg of additional fat or .53 kg of additional high fructose corn syrup, respectively. Feed was gradually increased from d 1 to 7 of lactation to 4.54 kg/d of the control diet (plus .45 kg of added fat and 1.33 kg of added fructose for treatments 2 and 3) and remained at these levels for the remainder of the 21 d lactation period. All treatments were iso-nitrogenous; treatments 2 and 3 were iso-caloric. Litter birth weights, number of pigs born alive, weaning weights and piglet survival rate were not affected by sow treatment. Stillbirths were less (P less than .05) for sows fed fat. Lipid content of milk 24 h post-farrowing was greater (P less than .05) from sows fed fat compared with sows fed fructose. Milk production estimates indicated that multiparous sows fed fat produced more (P less .05) milk than sows fed the control diet. On d 112 of gestation and d 15 of lactation, serial blood samples were drawn to monitor sow response to a glucose challenge (1 g/kg body weight).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Immune system dysregulation**: AD is associated with immune system changes, and genes like CD2AP, BIN1, and CLU are implicated in immune system dysfunction. The F3 gene, also known as the coagulation factor III gene, is involved in the coagulation cascade and has been linked to inflammation and immune responses.
2. **Coagulation and inflammation**: The F3 gene is associated with the production of tissue factor (TF), which is a transmembrane receptor that triggers coagulation and inflammation. TF has been shown to play a role in AD pathogenesis, and its expression is increased in AD brains.
3. **Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal dynamics**: Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, are involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and are implicated in AD. The F3 gene has been linked to Rho GTPase signaling, and alterations in Rho GTPase activity have been observed in AD.
4. **Podocyte injury and kidney disease**: Podocyte injury is a key event in proteinuric kidney disease, and genes like CD2AP and synaptopodin are involved in maintaining podocyte integrity. The F3 gene has been linked to kidney disease, and alterations in F3 expression have been observed in podocyte injury models.
5. **Epithelial cell polarity and junctions**: The PAR polarity complex, which includes CD2AP, is involved in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. The F3 gene has been linked to epithelial cell polarity and junctions, and alterations in F3 expression have been observed in models of epithelial cell dysfunction.

The possible indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD could be summarized as follows:

* The F3 wt Allele influences coagulation and inflammation through the production of tissue factor (TF), which is increased in AD brains.
* TF triggers coagulation and inflammation, leading to immune system dysregulation, which is a hallmark of AD.
* Immune system dysregulation and inflammation contribute to the disruption of cytoskeletal dynamics, which is regulated by Rho GTPases.
* Rho GTPase dysregulation contributes to podocyte injury and kidney disease, which are associated with AD.
* Podocyte injury and kidney disease lead to the disruption of epithelial cell polarity and junctions, which are critical for maintaining the blood-brain barrier and preventing AD-related neurodegeneration.

While this narrative provides a possible indirect link between the F3 wt Allele and AD, it is essential to note that the relationship between these entities is complex and likely involves multiple intermediate processes and genes. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this potential relationship.

Genetic perturbations of disease risk genes in mice capture transcriptomic signatures of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. New genetic and genomic resources have identified multiple genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and characterized this common dementia at the molecular level. Experimental studies in model organisms can validate these associations and elucidate the links between specific genetic factors and transcriptomic signatures. Animal models based on LOAD-associated genes can potentially connect common genetic variation with LOAD transcriptomes, thereby providing novel insights into basic biological mechanisms underlying the disease. We performed RNA-Seq on whole brain samples from a panel of six-month-old female mice, each carrying one of the following mutations: homozygous deletions of Apoe and Clu; hemizygous deletions of Bin1 and Cd2ap; and a transgenic APOEepsilon4. Similar data from a transgenic APP/PS1 model was included for comparison to early-onset variant effects. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules of correlated genes and each module was tested for differential expression by strain. We then compared mouse modules with human postmortem brain modules from the Accelerating Medicine's Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) to determine the LOAD-related processes affected by each genetic risk factor. Mouse modules were significantly enriched in multiple AD-related processes, including immune response, inflammation, lipid processing, endocytosis, and synaptic cell function. WGCNA modules were significantly associated with Apoe-/-, APOEepsilon4, Clu-/-, and APP/PS1 mouse models. Apoe-/-, GFAP-driven APOEepsilon4, and APP/PS1 driven modules overlapped with AMP-AD inflammation and microglial modules; Clu-/- driven modules overlapped with synaptic modules; and APP/PS1 modules separately overlapped with lipid-processing and metabolism modules. This study of genetic mouse models provides a basis to dissect the role of AD risk genes in relevant AD pathologies. We determined that different genetic perturbations affect different molecular mechanisms comprising AD, and mapped specific effects to each risk gene. Our approach provides a platform for further exploration into the causes and progression of AD by assessing animal models at different ages and/or with different combinations of LOAD risk variants.

Common variants at ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci reported by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) in a companion paper. We undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated variants with P <= 1 * 10(-5). We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7 (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 * 10(-17); including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 * 10(-21)) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 * 10(-14); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 * 10(-16)) are new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 8.6 * 10(-9)), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 * 10(-9)) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 * 10(-10)).

Genetic factors related to the immune system in subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the cause of dementia. Although the pathomechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease have not been fully elucidated, there is evidence that genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. Immune system changes, both environmentally-induced and, as a result of predisposing genetics, are implicated in Alzheimer's disease etiopathogenesis. Genes associated with immune system dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease include CLU, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7, HLA-DRB1, TREM2, EPHA1, and CD2AP. In particular, BIN1 and CLU, aberrations in which are thought to promote neurodegeneration by dysregulating exocytosis and immune processes, together with the E4 variant of the APOE gene, are among the most common genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. While the relationships between these genes in Alzheimer's disease have been examined, little information exists regarding their role as variables predisposing first or second-degree relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients to the illness. The rationale of this review is to suggest that individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease who have the BIN1-T/T variant may be at significant risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Also, the unfavorable BIN1-T variant is independent of APOE E4-associated risk. People at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease are more often carriers of the protective C-variant of the CLU gene, the presence of which might be associated with later-onset dementia observable within this high-risk group. It seems BIN1 and CLU together with, albeit independent of APOE E4, may be among the factors predisposing individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease to developing the illness.

Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility Genes in Malignant Breast Tumors. Cognitive problems have been reported in breast cancer patients after chemotherapy. A small group of older breast cancer survivors carrying the APOE4 gene, receiving chemotherapy, was at increased risk of long-term impairment of brain function. We have analyzed the expression of APOE and the next 23-ranked Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility genes in malignant breast tumors. We wished to determine if these 24 genes might be related to breast cancer. To identify the most important AD susceptibility genes, we consulted the ALZGENE database (www.alzgene.org/) which displays this information and regularly updates it. To analyze the effect of AD susceptibility genes on breast cancer, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We analyzed TCGA data with cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. cBioPortal provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomic data sets. cBioPortal can analyze APOE in breast tumors but cannot distinguish its three alleles: E2, E3, and E4. About 1.6% of the tumors had APOE amplification (copy number alteration). Two percent of the tumors had CD33 alterations. None of the tumors had APOE mutations. Two tumors had CD33 missense mutations of unknown significance. Expression heatmap shows that over- or underexpression of APOE and CD33 was correlated in most of the tumors. APOE alteration significantly co-occurred with CD33 and CD2AP. Alterations of certain cancer genes tend to co-occur, indicating that they may work in tandem to drive tumor formation and development. This may be the case with the co-occurring alterations of APOE, CD33, and CD2AP. It would be important to know which APOE allele(s) were co-occurrent with CD33 and CD2AP and whether co-occurrence in the tumor predicted increased risk of AD. This information could help in identification of specific risk factors for breast cancer-related cognitive decline in older women, which has important implications for oncology care.

The Adaptor Protein CD2AP Is a Coordinator of Neurotrophin Signaling-Mediated Axon Arbor Plasticity. Growth of intact axons of noninjured neurons, often termed collateral sprouting, contributes to both adaptive and pathological plasticity in the adult nervous system, but the intracellular factors controlling this growth are largely unknown. An automated functional assay of genes regulated in sensory neurons from the rat in vivo spared dermatome model of collateral sprouting identified the adaptor protein CD2-associated protein (CD2AP; human CMS) as a positive regulator of axon growth. In non-neuronal cells, CD2AP, like other adaptor proteins, functions to selectively control the spatial/temporal assembly of multiprotein complexes that transmit intracellular signals. Although CD2AP polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, its role in axon growth is unknown. Assessments of neurite arbor structure in vitro revealed CD2AP overexpression, and siRNA-mediated knockdown, modulated (1) neurite length, (2) neurite complexity, and (3) growth cone filopodia number, in accordance with CD2AP expression levels. We show, for the first time, that CD2AP forms a novel multiprotein complex with the NGF receptor TrkA and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, with the degree of TrkA:p85 association positively regulated by CD2AP levels. CD2AP also regulates NGF signaling through AKT, but not ERK, and regulates long-range signaling though TrkA(+)/RAB5(+) signaling endosomes. CD2AP mRNA and protein levels were increased in neurons during collateral sprouting but decreased following injury, suggesting that, although typically considered together, these two adult axonal growth processes are fundamentally different. These data position CD2AP as a major intracellular signaling molecule coordinating NGF signaling to regulate collateral sprouting and structural plasticity of intact adult axons. Growth of noninjured axons in the adult nervous system contributes to adaptive and maladaptive plasticity, and dysfunction of this process may contribute to neurologic pathologies. Functional screening of genes regulated during growth of noninjured axons revealed CD2AP as a positive regulator of axon outgrowth. A novel association of CD2AP with TrkA and p85 suggests a distinct intracellular signaling pathway regulating growth of noninjured axons. This may also represent a novel mechanism of generating specificity in multifunctional NGF signaling. Divergent regulation of CD2AP in different axon growth conditions suggests that separate mechanisms exist for different modes of axon growth. CD2AP is the first signaling molecule associated with adult sensory axonal collateral sprouting, and this association may offer new insights for NGF/TrkA-related Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.

Synaptopodin protects against proteinuria by disrupting Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling complexes in kidney podocytes. The actin-based foot processes of kidney podocytes and the interposed slit diaphragm form the final barrier to proteinuria. Mutations affecting several podocyte proteins cause disruption of the filtration barrier and rearrangement of the highly dynamic podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Proteins regulating the plasticity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton are therefore of critical importance for sustained kidney barrier function. Synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein essential for the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton because synaptopodin-deficient mice display impaired recovery from protamine sulfate-induced foot process effacement and lipopolysaccharide-induced nephrotic syndrome. Moreover, bigenic heterozygosity for synaptopodin and CD2AP is sufficient to induce spontaneous proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-like glomerular damage in mice. Mechanistically, synaptopodin induces stress fibers by blocking the proteasomal degradation of RhoA. Here we show that synaptopodin directly binds to IRSp53 and suppresses Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena-initiated filopodia formation by blocking the binding of Cdc42 and Mena to IRSp53. The Mena inhibitor FP(4)-Mito suppresses aberrant filopodia formation in synaptopodin knockdown podocytes, and when delivered into mice protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced proteinuria. The identification of synaptopodin as an inhibitor of Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling defines a novel antiproteinuric signaling pathway and offers new targets for the development of antiproteinuric therapeutic modalities.

DAPLE orchestrates apical actomyosin assembly from junctional polarity complexes.  Establishment of apicobasal polarity and the organization of the cytoskeleton must operate coordinately to ensure proper epithelial cell shape and function.  However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which polarity complexes directly instruct the cytoskeletal machinery to determine cell shape are poorly understood.  Here, we define a mechanism by which the PAR polarity complex (PAR3-PAR6-aPKC) at apical cell junctions leads to efficient assembly of the apical actomyosin network to maintain epithelial cell morphology.  We found that the PAR polarity complex recruits the protein DAPLE to apical cell junctions, which in turn triggers a two-pronged mechanism that converges upon assembly of apical actomyosin.  More specifically, DAPLE directly recruits the actin-stabilizing protein CD2AP to apical junctions and, concomitantly, activates heterotrimeric G protein signaling in a GPCR-independent manner to favor RhoA-myosin activation.  These observations establish DAPLE as a direct molecular link between junctional polarity complexes and the formation of apical cytoskeletal assemblies that support epithelial cell shape. 

Adrenomedullin ameliorates podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in vitro and in vivo through modulation of Rho GTPases. Podocyte injury is a key event in proteinuric kidney disease and eventually glomerular scarring. While adrenomedullin (AM), a potent vasodilatory peptide, has been reported to confer renoprotection in several experimental models of kidney diseases, its effect on injured podocytes and the related mechanism is still largely unknown. Employing Western blotting analysis, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we investigated the effects of AM on the expressions of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho-family small GTPases (Rho GTPases) in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced podocyte injury, both in cultured podocytes and in PAN nephrosis rats. Urinary protein excretion and the morphologic changes of kidney in PAN nephrosis rats were evaluated. Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay was applied for Rho GTPases activity. PAN induced massive albuminuria and morphologic injury, which were significantly mitigated by AM administration. AM significantly antagonized not only the PAN-decreased expressions of synaptopodin, nephrin, CD2AP and podocin, but also the PAN-disrupted interactions between synaptopodin-RhoA, nephrin-CD2AP, and CD2AP-Rac1-cortactin. These effects of AM in cultured podocytes were mostly significantly blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor. AM dramatically upregulated the PAN-induced Rho GTPases protein expressions and their activities. PAN increased the expressions of endogenous AM and its receptor RAMP2 which was furthermore upregulated by AM administration. AM alleviated podocyte injury induced by PAN both in cell culture and in PAN nephrosis. The beneficial effects of AM on podocytes can be attributable to direct modulation of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho GTPases, mainly via a PKA-dependent pathway.

Terminal care: how can we do better?

Integral role of RhoA activation in monocyte adhesion-triggered tissue factor expression in endothelial cells. The role of Rho activation in the regulation of tissue factor (TF) is not clear. This study was undertaken to investigate this in endothelial cells induced by monocyte adhesion. Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were added to cultured human coronary endothelial cells. Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells increased the levels of TF antigen in the endothelial cells. The results of transient transfection of the human TF promoter/luciferase gene into endothelial cells indicated that the increase in endothelial expression of the TF gene caused by monocyte adhesion occurred at the transcriptional level. The upregulation of TF was inhibited by statins, and the suppressive effect of statins was reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Monocyte adhesion rapidly upregulated the membrane translocation and GTP/GDP exchange of RhoA, but not of Cdc42 or Rac, in endothelial cells. Rho inhibition by C3 exoenzyme or adenovirus-mediated expression of N19RhoA prevented the endothelial upregulation of TF caused by monocyte adhesion, and this was mimicked by Rho-kinase inhibitors. Moreover, monocyte adhesion increased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 in endothelial cells, and this was prevented by statins and Rho inhibition. Our study shows that RhoA activation plays an integral role in TF expression in endothelial cells.

Subcellular localization of tissue factor and human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Tissue factor (TF) is the most relevant physiological trigger of thrombosis. Additionally TF is a transmembrane receptor with cell signaling functions. The aim of this study was to investigate TF subcellular localization, function and signaling in human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Coronary arteries and primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) were obtained from human explanted hearts. Wound repair and Boyden chamber assays were used to measure migration in vitro. TF-pro-coagulant activity (TF-PCA) was measured in extracted cellular membranes. Analysis of TF distribution was performed by confocal microscopy. A nucleofector device was used for TF and protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) silencing. mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. In migrating HVSMC TF translocates to the leading edge of the cells showing an intense patch-like staining in the lamellipodia. In the migrating front TF colocalizes with filamin (FLN) in the polarized lipid rafts. TF-PCA was increased in migrating cells. Silencing of the TF gene inhibits RSK-induced FLN-Ser-2152 phosphorylation, down-regulates CDC42, RhoA, and Rac1 protein expression and significantly inhibits cell migration. Silencing PAR2 also inhibits cell migration; however, silencing both TF and PAR2 induces a significantly higher effect on migration. Smooth muscle cells expressing TF have been identified in non-lipid-rich human coronary artery atherosclerotic plaques. TF translocates to the cell front in association with cytoskeleton proteins and regulates HVSMC migration by mechanisms dependent and independent of factor (F)VIIa/PAR2. These results extend the functional role of TF to smooth muscle cell trafficking in vessel wall remodeling.

Contractual incentives: a threat to evidence-based medicine?

Mechanisms of tolerance in the copper-loaded rat liver. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of copper-induced damage and subsequent recovery and tolerance to copper in the copper-loaded rat liver. Male Wistar rats were allocated randomly into groups of four, fed a pelleted diet containing 1500 mg/g copper, and killed at 1, 5, 6, 10, and 15 weeks. Two additional groups were treated as follows: (a) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks with normal rodent diet (group 5-0), (b) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks normal diet and 5 weeks of copper reloading (group 5-0-5). Control rats were fed a normal rodent diet that contained 18 mg/kg of copper. Tissues were collected for histology, histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and copper analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and X-ray microanalysis. In the rats continuously fed the high copper diet, copper concentration rose to 444 +/- 32 micrograms/g of liver (wet weight) by Week 1 and to 726 +/- 170 micrograms/g at Week 5, decreasing to 417 +/- 9 micrograms/g at Week 15. X-ray microanalysis and dot mapping microanalysis demonstrated copper within the nucleus, nucleolus, and lysosomes of these continuously loaded rats. Recovery with unloading of liver copper was demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative methods in group 5-0 (41.32 +/- 19 micrograms/g). Recovery and tolerance were associated with a reduction in nucleolar copper. Copper tolerance was demonstrated in group 5-0-5 and in continuously copper-loaded rats by Weeks 10 and 15. Copper tolerance was reflected by a change in intracellular levels and distribution of copper and an efficient copper unloading mechanism.

Effects of feeding sows fat or fructose during late gestation and lactation. The effects of dietary fat or fructose supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow milk production and composition and on progeny were examined. On d 88 of gestation, 24 sows were allotted by parity to three dietary treatments (eight sows/treatment). Treatments were 1) a 12.5% crude protein, corn-soybean meal control, 2) the control + 10% added fat or 3) the control + 23% high fructose corn syrup. All treatments were fed to supply 1.82 kg/d of the control diet from d 89 of gestation to parturition with sows in treatments 2 or 3 receiving .18 kg of additional fat or .53 kg of additional high fructose corn syrup, respectively. Feed was gradually increased from d 1 to 7 of lactation to 4.54 kg/d of the control diet (plus .45 kg of added fat and 1.33 kg of added fructose for treatments 2 and 3) and remained at these levels for the remainder of the 21 d lactation period. All treatments were iso-nitrogenous; treatments 2 and 3 were iso-caloric. Litter birth weights, number of pigs born alive, weaning weights and piglet survival rate were not affected by sow treatment. Stillbirths were less (P less than .05) for sows fed fat. Lipid content of milk 24 h post-farrowing was greater (P less than .05) from sows fed fat compared with sows fed fructose. Milk production estimates indicated that multiparous sows fed fat produced more (P less .05) milk than sows fed the control diet. On d 112 of gestation and d 15 of lactation, serial blood samples were drawn to monitor sow response to a glucose challenge (1 g/kg body weight).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **Immune system dysregulation**: AD is associated with immune system changes, and genes like CLU, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7, HLA-DRB1, TREM2, EPHA1, and CD2AP are implicated in immune system dysfunction (Abstract 3). The F3 gene, also known as coagulation factor III, is involved in the coagulation cascade and has been linked to inflammation and immune responses.
2. **Coagulation and inflammation**: Tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane receptor, plays a crucial role in coagulation and inflammation (Abstracts 8 and 9). TF is also involved in cell signaling and can regulate smooth muscle cell migration. The F3 gene product, tissue factor, might interact with other proteins and pathways involved in AD, such as the immune system and inflammation.
3. **CD2AP and cytoskeletal regulation**: CD2AP, a protein associated with AD risk, is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion (Abstracts 4 and 5). CD2AP interacts with other proteins, such as synaptopodin, to maintain podocyte structure and function. The F3 gene might influence CD2AP expression or activity, either directly or indirectly, through its role in coagulation and inflammation.
4. **Rho GTPase signaling**: Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, are essential for regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and inflammation (Abstracts 6 and 8). The F3 gene product, tissue factor, might interact with Rho GTPase signaling pathways, influencing AD-related processes like inflammation and cytoskeletal regulation.
5. **Epithelial cell polarity and morphology**: The PAR polarity complex and DAPLE regulate apical actomyosin assembly and epithelial cell morphology (Abstract 7). The F3 gene might influence these processes, either directly or indirectly, through its role in coagulation and inflammation, which could impact AD-related changes in brain morphology and function.

While there is no direct evidence linking the F3 wt Allele to AD in the provided abstracts, the connections between coagulation, inflammation, immune system dysregulation, cytoskeletal regulation, and Rho GTPase signaling provide a possible indirect relationship. The F3 gene might contribute to AD susceptibility through its involvement in these intermediate processes, which are implicated in AD pathogenesis.

To further explore this potential relationship, additional research would be necessary to:

1. Investigate the expression and activity of F3 in AD brains and its potential interaction with AD-related genes and pathways.
2. Examine the role of F3 in regulating immune system function, inflammation, and coagulation in the context of AD.
3. Determine whether F3 influences CD2AP expression or activity, and whether this interaction contributes to AD-related changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion.
4. Explore the potential connections between F3, Rho GTPase signaling, and epithelial cell polarity in the context of AD.

By elucidating these relationships, researchers may uncover a novel, indirect link between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility Genes in Malignant Breast Tumors. Cognitive problems have been reported in breast cancer patients after chemotherapy. A small group of older breast cancer survivors carrying the APOE4 gene, receiving chemotherapy, was at increased risk of long-term impairment of brain function. We have analyzed the expression of APOE and the next 23-ranked Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility genes in malignant breast tumors. We wished to determine if these 24 genes might be related to breast cancer. To identify the most important AD susceptibility genes, we consulted the ALZGENE database (www.alzgene.org/) which displays this information and regularly updates it. To analyze the effect of AD susceptibility genes on breast cancer, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We analyzed TCGA data with cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. cBioPortal provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomic data sets. cBioPortal can analyze APOE in breast tumors but cannot distinguish its three alleles: E2, E3, and E4. About 1.6% of the tumors had APOE amplification (copy number alteration). Two percent of the tumors had CD33 alterations. None of the tumors had APOE mutations. Two tumors had CD33 missense mutations of unknown significance. Expression heatmap shows that over- or underexpression of APOE and CD33 was correlated in most of the tumors. APOE alteration significantly co-occurred with CD33 and CD2AP. Alterations of certain cancer genes tend to co-occur, indicating that they may work in tandem to drive tumor formation and development. This may be the case with the co-occurring alterations of APOE, CD33, and CD2AP. It would be important to know which APOE allele(s) were co-occurrent with CD33 and CD2AP and whether co-occurrence in the tumor predicted increased risk of AD. This information could help in identification of specific risk factors for breast cancer-related cognitive decline in older women, which has important implications for oncology care.

The Adaptor Protein CD2AP Is a Coordinator of Neurotrophin Signaling-Mediated Axon Arbor Plasticity. Growth of intact axons of noninjured neurons, often termed collateral sprouting, contributes to both adaptive and pathological plasticity in the adult nervous system, but the intracellular factors controlling this growth are largely unknown. An automated functional assay of genes regulated in sensory neurons from the rat in vivo spared dermatome model of collateral sprouting identified the adaptor protein CD2-associated protein (CD2AP; human CMS) as a positive regulator of axon growth. In non-neuronal cells, CD2AP, like other adaptor proteins, functions to selectively control the spatial/temporal assembly of multiprotein complexes that transmit intracellular signals. Although CD2AP polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, its role in axon growth is unknown. Assessments of neurite arbor structure in vitro revealed CD2AP overexpression, and siRNA-mediated knockdown, modulated (1) neurite length, (2) neurite complexity, and (3) growth cone filopodia number, in accordance with CD2AP expression levels. We show, for the first time, that CD2AP forms a novel multiprotein complex with the NGF receptor TrkA and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, with the degree of TrkA:p85 association positively regulated by CD2AP levels. CD2AP also regulates NGF signaling through AKT, but not ERK, and regulates long-range signaling though TrkA(+)/RAB5(+) signaling endosomes. CD2AP mRNA and protein levels were increased in neurons during collateral sprouting but decreased following injury, suggesting that, although typically considered together, these two adult axonal growth processes are fundamentally different. These data position CD2AP as a major intracellular signaling molecule coordinating NGF signaling to regulate collateral sprouting and structural plasticity of intact adult axons. Growth of noninjured axons in the adult nervous system contributes to adaptive and maladaptive plasticity, and dysfunction of this process may contribute to neurologic pathologies. Functional screening of genes regulated during growth of noninjured axons revealed CD2AP as a positive regulator of axon outgrowth. A novel association of CD2AP with TrkA and p85 suggests a distinct intracellular signaling pathway regulating growth of noninjured axons. This may also represent a novel mechanism of generating specificity in multifunctional NGF signaling. Divergent regulation of CD2AP in different axon growth conditions suggests that separate mechanisms exist for different modes of axon growth. CD2AP is the first signaling molecule associated with adult sensory axonal collateral sprouting, and this association may offer new insights for NGF/TrkA-related Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.

HYDRA: Revealing heterogeneity of imaging and genetic patterns through a multiple max-margin discriminative analysis framework. Multivariate pattern analysis techniques have been increasingly used over the past decade to derive highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of diseases on an individual basis. The driving assumption behind the vast majority of the existing methodologies is that a single imaging pattern can distinguish between healthy and diseased populations, or between two subgroups of patients (e.g., progressors vs. non-progressors). This assumption effectively ignores the ample evidence for the heterogeneous nature of brain diseases. Neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are largely characterized by high clinical heterogeneity, which likely stems in part from underlying neuroanatomical heterogeneity of various pathologies. Detecting and characterizing heterogeneity may deepen our understanding of disease mechanisms and lead to patient-specific treatments. However, few approaches tackle disease subtype discovery in a principled machine learning framework. To address this challenge, we present a novel non-linear learning algorithm for simultaneous binary classification and subtype identification, termed HYDRA (Heterogeneity through Discriminative Analysis). Neuroanatomical subtypes are effectively captured by multiple linear hyperplanes, which form a convex polytope that separates two groups (e.g., healthy controls from pathologic samples); each face of this polytope effectively defines a disease subtype. We validated HYDRA on simulated and clinical data. In the latter case, we applied the proposed method independently to the imaging and genetic datasets of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1) study. The imaging dataset consisted of T1-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance images of 123 AD patients and 177 controls. The genetic dataset consisted of single nucleotide polymorphism information of 103 AD patients and 139 controls. We identified 3 reproducible subtypes of atrophy in AD relative to controls: (1) diffuse and extensive atrophy, (2) precuneus and extensive temporal lobe atrophy, as well some prefrontal atrophy, (3) atrophy pattern very much confined to the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe. The genetics dataset yielded two subtypes of AD characterized mainly by the presence/absence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 genotype, but also involving differential presence of risk alleles of CD2AP, SPON1 and LOC39095 SNPs that were associated with differences in the respective patterns of brain atrophy, especially in the precuneus. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to map disease heterogeneity in neuroimaging and genetic studies.

Synaptopodin protects against proteinuria by disrupting Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling complexes in kidney podocytes. The actin-based foot processes of kidney podocytes and the interposed slit diaphragm form the final barrier to proteinuria. Mutations affecting several podocyte proteins cause disruption of the filtration barrier and rearrangement of the highly dynamic podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Proteins regulating the plasticity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton are therefore of critical importance for sustained kidney barrier function. Synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein essential for the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton because synaptopodin-deficient mice display impaired recovery from protamine sulfate-induced foot process effacement and lipopolysaccharide-induced nephrotic syndrome. Moreover, bigenic heterozygosity for synaptopodin and CD2AP is sufficient to induce spontaneous proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-like glomerular damage in mice. Mechanistically, synaptopodin induces stress fibers by blocking the proteasomal degradation of RhoA. Here we show that synaptopodin directly binds to IRSp53 and suppresses Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena-initiated filopodia formation by blocking the binding of Cdc42 and Mena to IRSp53. The Mena inhibitor FP(4)-Mito suppresses aberrant filopodia formation in synaptopodin knockdown podocytes, and when delivered into mice protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced proteinuria. The identification of synaptopodin as an inhibitor of Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling defines a novel antiproteinuric signaling pathway and offers new targets for the development of antiproteinuric therapeutic modalities.

DAPLE orchestrates apical actomyosin assembly from junctional polarity complexes.  Establishment of apicobasal polarity and the organization of the cytoskeleton must operate coordinately to ensure proper epithelial cell shape and function.  However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which polarity complexes directly instruct the cytoskeletal machinery to determine cell shape are poorly understood.  Here, we define a mechanism by which the PAR polarity complex (PAR3-PAR6-aPKC) at apical cell junctions leads to efficient assembly of the apical actomyosin network to maintain epithelial cell morphology.  We found that the PAR polarity complex recruits the protein DAPLE to apical cell junctions, which in turn triggers a two-pronged mechanism that converges upon assembly of apical actomyosin.  More specifically, DAPLE directly recruits the actin-stabilizing protein CD2AP to apical junctions and, concomitantly, activates heterotrimeric G protein signaling in a GPCR-independent manner to favor RhoA-myosin activation.  These observations establish DAPLE as a direct molecular link between junctional polarity complexes and the formation of apical cytoskeletal assemblies that support epithelial cell shape. 

Adrenomedullin ameliorates podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in vitro and in vivo through modulation of Rho GTPases. Podocyte injury is a key event in proteinuric kidney disease and eventually glomerular scarring. While adrenomedullin (AM), a potent vasodilatory peptide, has been reported to confer renoprotection in several experimental models of kidney diseases, its effect on injured podocytes and the related mechanism is still largely unknown. Employing Western blotting analysis, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we investigated the effects of AM on the expressions of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho-family small GTPases (Rho GTPases) in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced podocyte injury, both in cultured podocytes and in PAN nephrosis rats. Urinary protein excretion and the morphologic changes of kidney in PAN nephrosis rats were evaluated. Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay was applied for Rho GTPases activity. PAN induced massive albuminuria and morphologic injury, which were significantly mitigated by AM administration. AM significantly antagonized not only the PAN-decreased expressions of synaptopodin, nephrin, CD2AP and podocin, but also the PAN-disrupted interactions between synaptopodin-RhoA, nephrin-CD2AP, and CD2AP-Rac1-cortactin. These effects of AM in cultured podocytes were mostly significantly blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor. AM dramatically upregulated the PAN-induced Rho GTPases protein expressions and their activities. PAN increased the expressions of endogenous AM and its receptor RAMP2 which was furthermore upregulated by AM administration. AM alleviated podocyte injury induced by PAN both in cell culture and in PAN nephrosis. The beneficial effects of AM on podocytes can be attributable to direct modulation of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho GTPases, mainly via a PKA-dependent pathway.

Terminal care: how can we do better?

Integral role of RhoA activation in monocyte adhesion-triggered tissue factor expression in endothelial cells. The role of Rho activation in the regulation of tissue factor (TF) is not clear. This study was undertaken to investigate this in endothelial cells induced by monocyte adhesion. Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were added to cultured human coronary endothelial cells. Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells increased the levels of TF antigen in the endothelial cells. The results of transient transfection of the human TF promoter/luciferase gene into endothelial cells indicated that the increase in endothelial expression of the TF gene caused by monocyte adhesion occurred at the transcriptional level. The upregulation of TF was inhibited by statins, and the suppressive effect of statins was reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Monocyte adhesion rapidly upregulated the membrane translocation and GTP/GDP exchange of RhoA, but not of Cdc42 or Rac, in endothelial cells. Rho inhibition by C3 exoenzyme or adenovirus-mediated expression of N19RhoA prevented the endothelial upregulation of TF caused by monocyte adhesion, and this was mimicked by Rho-kinase inhibitors. Moreover, monocyte adhesion increased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 in endothelial cells, and this was prevented by statins and Rho inhibition. Our study shows that RhoA activation plays an integral role in TF expression in endothelial cells.

Subcellular localization of tissue factor and human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Tissue factor (TF) is the most relevant physiological trigger of thrombosis. Additionally TF is a transmembrane receptor with cell signaling functions. The aim of this study was to investigate TF subcellular localization, function and signaling in human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Coronary arteries and primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) were obtained from human explanted hearts. Wound repair and Boyden chamber assays were used to measure migration in vitro. TF-pro-coagulant activity (TF-PCA) was measured in extracted cellular membranes. Analysis of TF distribution was performed by confocal microscopy. A nucleofector device was used for TF and protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) silencing. mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. In migrating HVSMC TF translocates to the leading edge of the cells showing an intense patch-like staining in the lamellipodia. In the migrating front TF colocalizes with filamin (FLN) in the polarized lipid rafts. TF-PCA was increased in migrating cells. Silencing of the TF gene inhibits RSK-induced FLN-Ser-2152 phosphorylation, down-regulates CDC42, RhoA, and Rac1 protein expression and significantly inhibits cell migration. Silencing PAR2 also inhibits cell migration; however, silencing both TF and PAR2 induces a significantly higher effect on migration. Smooth muscle cells expressing TF have been identified in non-lipid-rich human coronary artery atherosclerotic plaques. TF translocates to the cell front in association with cytoskeleton proteins and regulates HVSMC migration by mechanisms dependent and independent of factor (F)VIIa/PAR2. These results extend the functional role of TF to smooth muscle cell trafficking in vessel wall remodeling.

Contractual incentives: a threat to evidence-based medicine?

Mechanisms of tolerance in the copper-loaded rat liver. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of copper-induced damage and subsequent recovery and tolerance to copper in the copper-loaded rat liver. Male Wistar rats were allocated randomly into groups of four, fed a pelleted diet containing 1500 mg/g copper, and killed at 1, 5, 6, 10, and 15 weeks. Two additional groups were treated as follows: (a) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks with normal rodent diet (group 5-0), (b) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks normal diet and 5 weeks of copper reloading (group 5-0-5). Control rats were fed a normal rodent diet that contained 18 mg/kg of copper. Tissues were collected for histology, histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and copper analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and X-ray microanalysis. In the rats continuously fed the high copper diet, copper concentration rose to 444 +/- 32 micrograms/g of liver (wet weight) by Week 1 and to 726 +/- 170 micrograms/g at Week 5, decreasing to 417 +/- 9 micrograms/g at Week 15. X-ray microanalysis and dot mapping microanalysis demonstrated copper within the nucleus, nucleolus, and lysosomes of these continuously loaded rats. Recovery with unloading of liver copper was demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative methods in group 5-0 (41.32 +/- 19 micrograms/g). Recovery and tolerance were associated with a reduction in nucleolar copper. Copper tolerance was demonstrated in group 5-0-5 and in continuously copper-loaded rats by Weeks 10 and 15. Copper tolerance was reflected by a change in intracellular levels and distribution of copper and an efficient copper unloading mechanism.

Effects of feeding sows fat or fructose during late gestation and lactation. The effects of dietary fat or fructose supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow milk production and composition and on progeny were examined. On d 88 of gestation, 24 sows were allotted by parity to three dietary treatments (eight sows/treatment). Treatments were 1) a 12.5% crude protein, corn-soybean meal control, 2) the control + 10% added fat or 3) the control + 23% high fructose corn syrup. All treatments were fed to supply 1.82 kg/d of the control diet from d 89 of gestation to parturition with sows in treatments 2 or 3 receiving .18 kg of additional fat or .53 kg of additional high fructose corn syrup, respectively. Feed was gradually increased from d 1 to 7 of lactation to 4.54 kg/d of the control diet (plus .45 kg of added fat and 1.33 kg of added fructose for treatments 2 and 3) and remained at these levels for the remainder of the 21 d lactation period. All treatments were iso-nitrogenous; treatments 2 and 3 were iso-caloric. Litter birth weights, number of pigs born alive, weaning weights and piglet survival rate were not affected by sow treatment. Stillbirths were less (P less than .05) for sows fed fat. Lipid content of milk 24 h post-farrowing was greater (P less than .05) from sows fed fat compared with sows fed fructose. Milk production estimates indicated that multiparous sows fed fat produced more (P less .05) milk than sows fed the control diet. On d 112 of gestation and d 15 of lactation, serial blood samples were drawn to monitor sow response to a glucose challenge (1 g/kg body weight).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative connecting these elements:

1. **CD2AP as a common link**: CD2AP is identified as a susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's Disease in multiple abstracts. It is involved in various cellular processes, including axon growth, neurotrophin signaling, and actin cytoskeleton regulation.
2. **F3 gene and coagulation**: Although not directly mentioned in the abstracts, the F3 gene (also known as the tissue factor gene) plays a crucial role in coagulation. Tissue factor is the primary initiator of blood coagulation, and its expression is regulated by various factors, including RhoA activation.
3. **RhoA activation and cytoskeleton regulation**: RhoA activation is mentioned in several abstracts as a key regulator of cytoskeleton dynamics, including actin polymerization and filopodia formation. This process is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell shape and function.
4. **CD2AP and RhoA interaction**: CD2AP is shown to interact with RhoA and regulate its activity, which in turn affects the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction may be relevant to the development of Alzheimer's Disease, as dysregulation of the cytoskeleton has been implicated in AD pathogenesis.
5. **Inflammation and immune response**: Several abstracts highlight the importance of inflammation and immune response in Alzheimer's Disease. CD2AP is involved in regulating immune cell function, and its dysregulation may contribute to the inflammatory processes observed in AD.
6. **APOE and lipid metabolism**: APOE is a well-established risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease, and its variants (e.g., APOE4) are associated with disrupted lipid metabolism. CD2AP has been shown to interact with APOE, and its expression is correlated with APOE in breast tumors.
7. **Indirect link between F3 wt Allele and AD**: Although the F3 gene is not directly mentioned in the context of Alzheimer's Disease, its product, tissue factor, is involved in coagulation and may interact with CD2AP and RhoA. The F3 wt Allele may influence the expression or activity of tissue factor, which in turn affects the coagulation cascade and potentially contributes to the development of Alzheimer's Disease through the intermediate entities and processes mentioned above.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might involve the following pathway:

F3 wt Allele → Tissue factor expression/activity → RhoA activation → CD2AP regulation → Cytoskeleton dynamics and inflammation → APOE and lipid metabolism → Alzheimer's Disease

This narrative is speculative and based on the connections between the abstracts. Further research is necessary to confirm the existence and significance of this indirect relationship.

Genetic perturbations of disease risk genes in mice capture transcriptomic signatures of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. New genetic and genomic resources have identified multiple genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and characterized this common dementia at the molecular level. Experimental studies in model organisms can validate these associations and elucidate the links between specific genetic factors and transcriptomic signatures. Animal models based on LOAD-associated genes can potentially connect common genetic variation with LOAD transcriptomes, thereby providing novel insights into basic biological mechanisms underlying the disease. We performed RNA-Seq on whole brain samples from a panel of six-month-old female mice, each carrying one of the following mutations: homozygous deletions of Apoe and Clu; hemizygous deletions of Bin1 and Cd2ap; and a transgenic APOEepsilon4. Similar data from a transgenic APP/PS1 model was included for comparison to early-onset variant effects. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules of correlated genes and each module was tested for differential expression by strain. We then compared mouse modules with human postmortem brain modules from the Accelerating Medicine's Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) to determine the LOAD-related processes affected by each genetic risk factor. Mouse modules were significantly enriched in multiple AD-related processes, including immune response, inflammation, lipid processing, endocytosis, and synaptic cell function. WGCNA modules were significantly associated with Apoe-/-, APOEepsilon4, Clu-/-, and APP/PS1 mouse models. Apoe-/-, GFAP-driven APOEepsilon4, and APP/PS1 driven modules overlapped with AMP-AD inflammation and microglial modules; Clu-/- driven modules overlapped with synaptic modules; and APP/PS1 modules separately overlapped with lipid-processing and metabolism modules. This study of genetic mouse models provides a basis to dissect the role of AD risk genes in relevant AD pathologies. We determined that different genetic perturbations affect different molecular mechanisms comprising AD, and mapped specific effects to each risk gene. Our approach provides a platform for further exploration into the causes and progression of AD by assessing animal models at different ages and/or with different combinations of LOAD risk variants.

Common variants at ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci reported by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) in a companion paper. We undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated variants with P <= 1 * 10(-5). We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7 (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 * 10(-17); including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 * 10(-21)) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 * 10(-14); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 * 10(-16)) are new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 8.6 * 10(-9)), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 * 10(-9)) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 * 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 * 10(-10)).

It would be important to know which APOE allele(s) were co-occurrent with CD33 and CD2AP and whether co-occurrence in the tumor predicted increased risk of AD.

Associations of Alzheimer's disease risk variants with gene expression, amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes, although the detailed mechanism through which all these genes are associated with AD pathogenesis remains unknown. We comprehensively evaluate the roles of the variants in top 30 non-APOE AD risk genes, based on whether these variants were associated with altered mRNA transcript levels, as well as brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration. Human brain gene expression data were obtained from the UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC), while other data used in our study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We examined the association of AD risk allele carrier status with the levels of gene expression in blood and brain regions and tested the association with brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration at baseline, using a multivariable linear regression model. Next, we analyzed the longitudinal effects of these variants on the change rates of pathology using a mixed effect model. Altogether, 27 variants were detected to be associated with the altered expression of 21 nearby genes in blood and brain regions. Eleven variants (especially novel variants in ADAM10, IGHV1-68, and SLC24A4/RIN3) were associated with brain amyloidosis, 7 variants (especially in INPP5D, PTK2B) with brain tauopathy, and 8 variants (especially in ECHDC3, HS3ST1) with brain neurodegeneration. Variants in ADAMTS1, BZRAP1-AS1, CELF1, CD2AP, and SLC24A4/RIN3 participated in more than one cerebral pathological process. Genetic variants might play functional roles and suggest potential mechanisms in AD pathogenesis, which opens doors to uncover novel targets for AD treatment.

Synaptopodin protects against proteinuria by disrupting Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling complexes in kidney podocytes. The actin-based foot processes of kidney podocytes and the interposed slit diaphragm form the final barrier to proteinuria. Mutations affecting several podocyte proteins cause disruption of the filtration barrier and rearrangement of the highly dynamic podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Proteins regulating the plasticity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton are therefore of critical importance for sustained kidney barrier function.

Mechanistically, synaptopodin induces stress fibers by blocking the proteasomal degradation of RhoA. Here we show that synaptopodin directly binds to IRSp53 and suppresses Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena-initiated filopodia formation by blocking the binding of Cdc42 and Mena to IRSp53. The Mena inhibitor FP(4)-Mito suppresses aberrant filopodia formation in synaptopodin knockdown podocytes, and when delivered into mice protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced proteinuria. The identification of synaptopodin as an inhibitor of Cdc42:IRSp53:Mena signaling defines a novel antiproteinuric signaling pathway and offers new targets for the development of antiproteinuric therapeutic modalities.

DAPLE orchestrates apical actomyosin assembly from junctional polarity complexes.  Establishment of apicobasal polarity and the organization of the cytoskeleton must operate coordinately to ensure proper epithelial cell shape and function.  However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which polarity complexes directly instruct the cytoskeletal machinery to determine cell shape are poorly understood.  Here, we define a mechanism by which the PAR polarity complex (PAR3-PAR6-aPKC) at apical cell junctions leads to efficient assembly of the apical actomyosin network to maintain epithelial cell morphology.  We found that the PAR polarity complex recruits the protein DAPLE to apical cell junctions, which in turn triggers a two-pronged mechanism that converges upon assembly of apical actomyosin.  More specifically, DAPLE directly recruits the actin-stabilizing protein CD2AP to apical junctions and, concomitantly, activates heterotrimeric G protein signaling in a GPCR-independent manner to favor RhoA-myosin activation.  These observations establish DAPLE as a direct molecular link between junctional polarity complexes and the formation of apical cytoskeletal assemblies that support epithelial cell shape. 

Adrenomedullin ameliorates podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in vitro and in vivo through modulation of Rho GTPases. Podocyte injury is a key event in proteinuric kidney disease and eventually glomerular scarring. While adrenomedullin (AM), a potent vasodilatory peptide, has been reported to confer renoprotection in several experimental models of kidney diseases, its effect on injured podocytes and the related mechanism is still largely unknown. Employing Western blotting analysis, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we investigated the effects of AM on the expressions of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho-family small GTPases (Rho GTPases) in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced podocyte injury, both in cultured podocytes and in PAN nephrosis rats. Urinary protein excretion and the morphologic changes of kidney in PAN nephrosis rats were evaluated. Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay was applied for Rho GTPases activity. PAN induced massive albuminuria and morphologic injury, which were significantly mitigated by AM administration. AM significantly antagonized not only the PAN-decreased expressions of synaptopodin, nephrin, CD2AP and podocin, but also the PAN-disrupted interactions between synaptopodin-RhoA, nephrin-CD2AP, and CD2AP-Rac1-cortactin. These effects of AM in cultured podocytes were mostly significantly blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor. AM dramatically upregulated the PAN-induced Rho GTPases protein expressions and their activities. PAN increased the expressions of endogenous AM and its receptor RAMP2 which was furthermore upregulated by AM administration. AM alleviated podocyte injury induced by PAN both in cell culture and in PAN nephrosis. The beneficial effects of AM on podocytes can be attributable to direct modulation of podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and Rho GTPases, mainly via a PKA-dependent pathway.

Terminal care: how can we do better?

Integral role of RhoA activation in monocyte adhesion-triggered tissue factor expression in endothelial cells. The role of Rho activation in the regulation of tissue factor (TF) is not clear. This study was undertaken to investigate this in endothelial cells induced by monocyte adhesion. Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were added to cultured human coronary endothelial cells. Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells increased the levels of TF antigen in the endothelial cells. The results of transient transfection of the human TF promoter/luciferase gene into endothelial cells indicated that the increase in endothelial expression of the TF gene caused by monocyte adhesion occurred at the transcriptional level. The upregulation of TF was inhibited by statins, and the suppressive effect of statins was reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Monocyte adhesion rapidly upregulated the membrane translocation and GTP/GDP exchange of RhoA, but not of Cdc42 or Rac, in endothelial cells. Rho inhibition by C3 exoenzyme or adenovirus-mediated expression of N19RhoA prevented the endothelial upregulation of TF caused by monocyte adhesion, and this was mimicked by Rho-kinase inhibitors. Moreover, monocyte adhesion increased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 in endothelial cells, and this was prevented by statins and Rho inhibition. Our study shows that RhoA activation plays an integral role in TF expression in endothelial cells.

Subcellular localization of tissue factor and human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Tissue factor (TF) is the most relevant physiological trigger of thrombosis. Additionally TF is a transmembrane receptor with cell signaling functions. The aim of this study was to investigate TF subcellular localization, function and signaling in human coronary artery smooth muscle cell migration. Coronary arteries and primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) were obtained from human explanted hearts. Wound repair and Boyden chamber assays were used to measure migration in vitro. TF-pro-coagulant activity (TF-PCA) was measured in extracted cellular membranes. Analysis of TF distribution was performed by confocal microscopy. A nucleofector device was used for TF and protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) silencing. mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. In migrating HVSMC TF translocates to the leading edge of the cells showing an intense patch-like staining in the lamellipodia. In the migrating front TF colocalizes with filamin (FLN) in the polarized lipid rafts. TF-PCA was increased in migrating cells. Silencing of the TF gene inhibits RSK-induced FLN-Ser-2152 phosphorylation, down-regulates CDC42, RhoA, and Rac1 protein expression and significantly inhibits cell migration. Silencing PAR2 also inhibits cell migration; however, silencing both TF and PAR2 induces a significantly higher effect on migration. Smooth muscle cells expressing TF have been identified in non-lipid-rich human coronary artery atherosclerotic plaques. TF translocates to the cell front in association with cytoskeleton proteins and regulates HVSMC migration by mechanisms dependent and independent of factor (F)VIIa/PAR2. These results extend the functional role of TF to smooth muscle cell trafficking in vessel wall remodeling.

Contractual incentives: a threat to evidence-based medicine?

Mechanisms of tolerance in the copper-loaded rat liver. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of copper-induced damage and subsequent recovery and tolerance to copper in the copper-loaded rat liver. Male Wistar rats were allocated randomly into groups of four, fed a pelleted diet containing 1500 mg/g copper, and killed at 1, 5, 6, 10, and 15 weeks. Two additional groups were treated as follows: (a) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks with normal rodent diet (group 5-0), (b) 5 weeks copper loading followed by 5 weeks normal diet and 5 weeks of copper reloading (group 5-0-5). Control rats were fed a normal rodent diet that contained 18 mg/kg of copper. Tissues were collected for histology, histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and copper analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and X-ray microanalysis. In the rats continuously fed the high copper diet, copper concentration rose to 444 +/- 32 micrograms/g of liver (wet weight) by Week 1 and to 726 +/- 170 micrograms/g at Week 5, decreasing to 417 +/- 9 micrograms/g at Week 15. X-ray microanalysis and dot mapping microanalysis demonstrated copper within the nucleus, nucleolus, and lysosomes of these continuously loaded rats. Recovery with unloading of liver copper was demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative methods in group 5-0 (41.32 +/- 19 micrograms/g). Recovery and tolerance were associated with a reduction in nucleolar copper. Copper tolerance was demonstrated in group 5-0-5 and in continuously copper-loaded rats by Weeks 10 and 15. Copper tolerance was reflected by a change in intracellular levels and distribution of copper and an efficient copper unloading mechanism.

Effects of feeding sows fat or fructose during late gestation and lactation. The effects of dietary fat or fructose supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow milk production and composition and on progeny were examined. On d 88 of gestation, 24 sows were allotted by parity to three dietary treatments (eight sows/treatment). Treatments were 1) a 12.5% crude protein, corn-soybean meal control, 2) the control + 10% added fat or 3) the control + 23% high fructose corn syrup. All treatments were fed to supply 1.82 kg/d of the control diet from d 89 of gestation to parturition with sows in treatments 2 or 3 receiving .18 kg of additional fat or .53 kg of additional high fructose corn syrup, respectively. Feed was gradually increased from d 1 to 7 of lactation to 4.54 kg/d of the control diet (plus .45 kg of added fat and 1.33 kg of added fructose for treatments 2 and 3) and remained at these levels for the remainder of the 21 d lactation period. All treatments were iso-nitrogenous; treatments 2 and 3 were iso-caloric. Litter birth weights, number of pigs born alive, weaning weights and piglet survival rate were not affected by sow treatment. Stillbirths were less (P less than .05) for sows fed fat. Lipid content of milk 24 h post-farrowing was greater (P less than .05) from sows fed fat compared with sows fed fructose. Milk production estimates indicated that multiparous sows fed fat produced more (P less .05) milk than sows fed the control diet. On d 112 of gestation and d 15 of lactation, serial blood samples were drawn to monitor sow response to a glucose challenge (1 g/kg body weight).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might exist through several intermediate entities and processes. Here's a possible narrative that connects these elements:

1. **Genetic risk factors for AD**: The abstracts mention several genetic risk factors for AD, including ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33, and CD2AP. These genes are associated with various biological processes, such as lipid processing, immune response, and synaptic cell function, which are disrupted in AD.
2. **CD2AP and its role in AD**: CD2AP is a gene that has been consistently associated with AD risk. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and has been shown to interact with other proteins, such as synaptopodin, to maintain the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton.
3. **Synaptopodin and podocyte function**: Synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Podocytes are specialized cells in the kidney that are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. Disruption of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton can lead to proteinuria and kidney damage.
4. **Rho GTPases and cytoskeleton regulation**: Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and are involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and adhesion.
5. **F3 gene and coagulation**: The F3 gene encodes for tissue factor (TF), which is a transmembrane receptor that initiates the coagulation cascade. TF is also involved in cell signaling and has been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.
6. **Potential link between F3 wt Allele and AD**: Although there is no direct mention of the F3 wt Allele in the abstracts, it is possible that the F3 gene, through its role in coagulation and cell signaling, may interact with other genes and pathways that are associated with AD risk. For example, the F3 gene may regulate the expression or activity of CD2AP or synaptopodin, which are involved in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Disruption of this process could contribute to the development of AD.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and AD might exist through the following pathway:

F3 wt Allele → regulation of coagulation and cell signaling → interaction with CD2AP and synaptopodin → disruption of podocyte actin cytoskeleton → contribution to AD pathogenesis

This narrative is highly speculative and requires further research to confirm the potential link between the F3 wt Allele and AD. However, it highlights the complexity of the biological processes involved in AD and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective therapeutic strategies.

Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) affect a large percent of the population worldwide. Experimental studies have revealed that T2DM and AD share several molecular processes that underlie their respective degenerative pathology. Based on this information, we quantified TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels, serum glucose, serum triglyceride, hepatic triglyceride, serum AST, serum ALT and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in various rat tissues. HFD was fed to rats resulting in increased body weight, fasting blood glucose, IL-6, TNF-alpha levels, hepatic triglyceride, serum AST, serum ALT and BuChE. SK0506 treatment significantly prevented weight gain induced by HFD feeding. SK0506, but not Rosiglitazone, significantly reduced serum and hepatic triglycerides levels. Treatment with SK0506 also ameliorated elevated levels of both inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST) significantly in HFD fed rats. BuChE activity also reduced in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of rats treated by SK0506. In conclusion, current study has opened new potential avenues towards research for management of T2DM and AD by Chinese herbal extracts, ''SK0506''.

Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study. Serum lipid levels such as triglyceride and cholesterol has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it still remains controversial in different studies. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the importance of serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in AD and MCI patients. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) system database were used to identify 17 studies (10 AD-only + 4 MCI-only + 3 shared AD/MCI), including 2333 cases and 3615 healthy controls (HC). We found that compared with HC, both the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.58; 95%CI (0.25, 0.90); P = 0.001) and the serum LDL-C levels [SMD = 0.7780; 95%CI (0.3940, 1.1521); P = 0.000] were higher in cognitive impairment population (including AD and MCI) than those in HC, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed the serum TC and LDL-C levels in AD and MCI patients. We found that the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.76; 95% CI (0.13, 1.40); P = 0.019]1 and the LDL-C levels [SMD = 1.40; 95% CI (0.70, 2.10; P = 0.000] were increased in AD patients. In the MCI patients, the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.30; 95%CI (0.01, 0.59); P = 0.041] had a significantly upward trend, while the LDL-C levels had no significant change, compared with HC subjects. However, there is no significant changes in HDL-C and TG levels in AD or MCI patients. Therefore, our results suggested that the elevated TC and LDL-C levels may be a potential risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Global Effects of DDX3 Inhibition on Cell Cycle Regulation Identified by a Combined Phosphoproteomics and Single Cell Tracking Approach. DDX3 is an RNA helicase with oncogenic properties. The small molecule inhibitor RK-33 is designed to fit into the ATP binding cleft of DDX3 and hereby block its activity. RK-33 has shown potent activity in preclinical cancer models. However, the mechanism behind the antineoplastic activity of RK-33 remains largely unknown. In this study we used a dual phosphoproteomic and single cell tracking approach to evaluate the effect of RK-33 on cancer cells. MDA-MB-435 cells were treated for 24 hours with RK-33 or vehicle control. Changes in phosphopeptide abundance were analyzed with quantitative mass spectrometry using isobaric mass tags (Tandem Mass Tags). At the proteome level we mainly observed changes in mitochondrial translation, cell division pathways and proteins related to cell cycle progression. Analysis of the phosphoproteome indicated decreased CDK1 activity after RK-33 treatment. To further evaluate the effect of DDX3 inhibition on cell cycle progression over time, we performed timelapse microscopy of Fluorescent Ubiquitin Cell Cycle Indicators labeled cells after RK-33 or siDDX3 exposure. Single cell tracking indicated that DDX3 inhibition resulted in a global delay in cell cycle progression in interphase and mitosis. In addition, we observed an increase in endoreduplication. Overall, we conclude that DDX3 inhibition affects cells in all phases and causes a global cell cycle progression delay.

Behavioral weight loss for the management of menopausal hot flashes: a pilot study. Although adiposity has been considered to be protective against hot flashes, newer data suggest positive relationships between hot flashes and adiposity. No studies have been specifically designed to test whether weight loss reduces hot flashes. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of behavioral weight loss in reducing hot flashes. Forty overweight or obese women with hot flashes (>= 4 hot flashes/d) were randomized to either behavioral weight loss intervention or wait-list control. Hot flashes were assessed before and after intervention via physiologic monitoring, diary, and questionnaire. Comparisons of changes in hot flashes and anthropometrics between conditions were performed via Wilcoxon tests. Study retention (83%) and intervention satisfaction (93.8%) were high. Most women (74.1%) reported that hot flash reduction was a major motivator for losing weight. Women randomized to the weight loss intervention lost more weight (-8.86 kg) than did women randomized to control (+0.23 kg; P < 0.0001). Women randomized to weight loss also showed greater reductions in questionnaire-reported hot flashes (2-wk hot flashes, -63.0) than did women in the control group (-28.0; P = 0.03)-a difference not demonstrated in other hot flash measures. Reductions in weight and hot flashes were significantly correlated (eg, r = 0.47, P = 0.006). This pilot study shows a behavioral weight loss program that is feasible, acceptable, and effective in producing weight loss among overweight or obese women with hot flashes. Findings indicate the importance of a larger study designed to test behavioral weight loss for hot flash reduction. Hot flash management could motivate women to engage in this health-promoting behavior.

pH-responsive DNA-binding activity of Helicobacter pylori NikR. Helicobacter pylori NikR (HpNikR) is a nickel-responsive transcription factor. In addition to a role in nickel homeostasis, HpNikR is proposed to serve as a master activator-repressor for H. pylori acid adaptation by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a battery of genes. One potential mechanism of this regulation is modulation of the DNA-binding activity of HpNikR by the decrease in internal pH that occurs upon exposure to acidic shock. To test this hypothesis, several properties of HpNikR were investigated under acidic conditions. At pH 5.8, the secondary and quaternary structures of the protein are not affected, and it still binds stoichiometric nickel in the same site, although with a slightly weaker affinity than that at pH 7.6. DNA-binding assays performed at pH 5.8 reveal that, in contrast to pH 7.6, HpNikR binds to the ureA promoter in a nickel-independent fashion. Binding to the nikR promoter at the lower pH is nickel dependent, however. Deletion of amino acids 3-11 of HpNikR abolished the nickel-responsive activity and enhanced nonspecific DNA binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of HpNikR indicates that either Asp7 or Asp8 in the N-terminus of HpNikR plays a part in the activation of DNA binding. Furthermore, Lys6 contributes selectively to complex formation with the nikR promoter sequence. The direct influence of pH on the activity of HpNikR may be critical to the role of this activator-repressor in the viability of H. pylori.

Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats. To evaluate the effects of different types of dietary fats on the hepatic lipid content and oxidative stress parameters in rat liver with experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups. The rats in the control group (n = 8) were on chow diet (Group 1), rats (n = 6) on methionine choline-deficient diet (MCDD) (Group 2), rats (n = 6) on MCDD enriched with olive oil (Group 3), rats (n = 6) on MCDD with fish oil (Group 4) and rats (n = 6) on MCDD with butter fat (Group 5). After 2 mo, blood and liver sections were examined for lipids composition and oxidative stress parameters. The liver weight/rat weight ratio increased in all treatment groups as compared with the control group. Severe fatty liver was seen in MCDD + fish oil and in MCDD + butter fat groups, but not in MCDD and MCDD + olive oil groups. The increase in hepatic triglycerides (TG) levels was blunted by 30% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.59 +/- 0.09) compared with MCDD group (0.85 +/- 0.04, P < 0.004), by 37% compared with MCDD + fish oil group (0.95 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001), and by 33% compared with MCDD + butter group (0.09 +/- 0.1, P < 0.01). The increase in serum TG was lowered by 10% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.9 +/- 0.07) compared with MCDD group (1.05 +/- 0.06). Hepatic cholesterol increased by 15-fold in MCDD group [(0.08 +/- 0.02, this increment was blunted by 21% in MCDD + fish oil group (0.09 +/- 0.02)]. In comparison with the control group, ratio of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-6/omega-3 increased in MCDD + olive oil, MCDD + fish oil and MCDD + butter fat groups by 345-, 30- and 397-fold, respectively. In comparison to MCDD group (1.58 +/- 0.08), hepatic MDA contents in MCDD + olive oil (3.3 +/- 0.6), MCDD + fish oil (3.0 +/- 0.4), and MCDD + butter group (2.9 +/- 0.36) were increased by 108%, 91% and 87%, respectively (P < 0.004). Hepatic paraoxonase activity decreased significantly in all treatment groups, mostly with MCDD + olive oil group (-68%). Olive oil decreases the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver of rats with NAFLD, but does not provide the greatest antioxidant activity.

The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity. Obesity activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in adipose tissue. Elevated levels of eosinophils with depression of monocyte and neutrophil indicate the deficiencies in the immune system of morbidly obese individuals. Actually, adipose tissue macrophages are functional antigen-presenting cells that promote the proliferation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing CD4+ T cells in adipose tissue of obese subjects. Eventually, diet-induced obesity is associated with the loss of tissue homeostasis and development of type 1 inflammatory responses in visceral adipose tissue. Activity of inducible indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) plays a major role under pro-inflammatory, IFN-gamma dominated settings. One of the two rate-limiting enzymes which can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenine is IDO-1. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) correlates with IDO-1 in adipose compartments. Actually, IDO-1-mediated tryptophan catabolism due to chronic immune activation is the cause of reduced tryptophan plasma levels and be considered as the driving force for food intake in morbidly obese patients. Thus, decrease in plasma tryptophan levels and subsequent reduction in serotonin (5-HT) production provokes satiety dysregulation that leads to increased caloric uptake and obesity. However, after bariatric surgery, weight reduction does not lead to normalization of IDO-1 activity. Furthermore, there is a connection between arginine and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates. Hence, abdominal obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability. IFN-gamma-induced activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and dissociation of endothelial adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)- phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)- endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway enhances oxidative stress production secondary to high-fat diet. Thus, reduced endothelial NO availability correlates with the increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides levels. Additionally, in obese patients, folate-deficiency leads to hyperhomocysteinemia. Folic acid confers protection against hyperhomocysteinemia-induced oxidative stress.

Yeast-derived potato patatins: Biochemical and biophysical characterization. Potato patatin is considered a valuable plant protein by the food industry for its exceptional functional properties and nutritional value. Nonetheless, it has not been widely used due to its low abundance in potatoes and high cost. Pichia pastoris was utilized for expression of patatin to overcome agricultural limitations. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of Patatin-B2 (rPatB2) and Patatin-17 (rPat17) is described. rPatB2 and rPat17 had higher zeta potential and superior solubility at various pH conditions in comparison with commercial patatin, whereas particle size distribution was similar. Inflection temperatures were higher than potato isolated patatins. Antioxidant capacity of rPatB2 and rPat17 was similar to that of commercial patatin and the specific enzymatic activity of rPatB2 was 5-fold higher than rPat17 and patatins isolated from potato. Results indicate yeast-derived patatin properties are comparable to patatins from potatoes, suggesting their potential use in various plant-based products such as meat and dairy analogues.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

Current status of closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus. Closed circuit diving systems are certainly not a new concept, but advanced technology is turning the concept into practical reality. For years the development of these systems has stagnated in their classified covert operations role, but a new group of sophisticated divers--scientists, photographers and technical divers--has emerged to spur the commercial development of closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus. The traditional silent and bubble-free capability is being augmented with such additions as microprocessor usage, dependable oxygen sensing, carbon dioxide sensing, and PC integration.

To describe an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease, we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and connect the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes to form a coherent narrative. Although none of the abstracts directly mention the F3 wt Allele, we can infer potential connections through the discussion of related biological processes and risk factors associated with Alzheimer's Disease.

1. **Inflammation and Alzheimer's Disease**: The first abstract discusses the link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), highlighting shared molecular processes and the role of inflammation. Elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 are associated with both conditions. This suggests that factors influencing inflammatory pathways could indirectly affect the risk or progression of Alzheimer's Disease.

2. **Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease**: The second abstract explores the relationship between serum lipid levels (such as total cholesterol and LDL-C) and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's Disease. It finds that higher levels of TC and LDL-C are associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. This implies that genetic or environmental factors affecting lipid metabolism could have an indirect impact on Alzheimer's Disease risk.

3. **Obesity, Inflammation, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The fourth and fifth abstracts touch on obesity and its metabolic consequences, including inflammation and alterations in lipid profiles. Obesity is known to increase the risk of developing T2DM and may also have a link to Alzheimer's Disease through shared pathways involving inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

4. **Homocysteine, Folate, and Vascular Health**: The abstract on homocysteine highlights its role as a risk factor for vascular disease and thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels can lead to endothelial dysfunction and are associated with decreased folate levels, which might indirectly influence cognitive health and potentially the risk of Alzheimer's Disease through vascular mechanisms.

5. **Genetic Factors and Metabolic Pathways**: Although not directly mentioned, genetic factors like the F3 wt Allele could influence metabolic pathways, inflammation, and vascular health. For instance, if the F3 wt Allele affects lipid metabolism, homocysteine levels, or inflammatory responses, it could indirectly influence the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist if the allele influences any of the following:

- **Lipid Metabolism**: By affecting TC and LDL-C levels, thereby increasing the risk of cognitive impairment.
- **Inflammatory Pathways**: By modulating the levels of inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, which are associated with both T2DM and Alzheimer's Disease.
- **Homocysteine Levels**: By impacting folate metabolism or directly influencing homocysteine levels, thereby affecting vascular health and potentially cognitive function.
- **Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome**: By contributing to the development of obesity or metabolic syndrome, which are linked to increased risks of T2DM and possibly Alzheimer's Disease through inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

In conclusion, while the abstracts do not directly address the F3 wt Allele, they provide insights into potential indirect pathways through which genetic factors influencing metabolism, inflammation, and vascular health could impact the risk of Alzheimer's Disease. Further research would be necessary to establish a specific connection between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease.

Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) affect a large percent of the population worldwide. Experimental studies have revealed that T2DM and AD share several molecular processes that underlie their respective degenerative pathology. Based on this information, we quantified TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels, serum glucose, serum triglyceride, hepatic triglyceride, serum AST, serum ALT and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in various rat tissues. HFD was fed to rats resulting in increased body weight, fasting blood glucose, IL-6, TNF-alpha levels, hepatic triglyceride, serum AST, serum ALT and BuChE. SK0506 treatment significantly prevented weight gain induced by HFD feeding. SK0506, but not Rosiglitazone, significantly reduced serum and hepatic triglycerides levels. Treatment with SK0506 also ameliorated elevated levels of both inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST) significantly in HFD fed rats. BuChE activity also reduced in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of rats treated by SK0506. In conclusion, current study has opened new potential avenues towards research for management of T2DM and AD by Chinese herbal extracts, ''SK0506''.

Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study. Serum lipid levels such as triglyceride and cholesterol has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it still remains controversial in different studies. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the importance of serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in AD and MCI patients. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) system database were used to identify 17 studies (10 AD-only + 4 MCI-only + 3 shared AD/MCI), including 2333 cases and 3615 healthy controls (HC). We found that compared with HC, both the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.58; 95%CI (0.25, 0.90); P = 0.001) and the serum LDL-C levels [SMD = 0.7780; 95%CI (0.3940, 1.1521); P = 0.000] were higher in cognitive impairment population (including AD and MCI) than those in HC, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed the serum TC and LDL-C levels in AD and MCI patients. We found that the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.76; 95% CI (0.13, 1.40); P = 0.019]1 and the LDL-C levels [SMD = 1.40; 95% CI (0.70, 2.10; P = 0.000] were increased in AD patients. In the MCI patients, the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.30; 95%CI (0.01, 0.59); P = 0.041] had a significantly upward trend, while the LDL-C levels had no significant change, compared with HC subjects. However, there is no significant changes in HDL-C and TG levels in AD or MCI patients. Therefore, our results suggested that the elevated TC and LDL-C levels may be a potential risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Global Effects of DDX3 Inhibition on Cell Cycle Regulation Identified by a Combined Phosphoproteomics and Single Cell Tracking Approach. DDX3 is an RNA helicase with oncogenic properties. The small molecule inhibitor RK-33 is designed to fit into the ATP binding cleft of DDX3 and hereby block its activity. RK-33 has shown potent activity in preclinical cancer models. However, the mechanism behind the antineoplastic activity of RK-33 remains largely unknown. In this study we used a dual phosphoproteomic and single cell tracking approach to evaluate the effect of RK-33 on cancer cells. MDA-MB-435 cells were treated for 24 hours with RK-33 or vehicle control. Changes in phosphopeptide abundance were analyzed with quantitative mass spectrometry using isobaric mass tags (Tandem Mass Tags). At the proteome level we mainly observed changes in mitochondrial translation, cell division pathways and proteins related to cell cycle progression. Analysis of the phosphoproteome indicated decreased CDK1 activity after RK-33 treatment. To further evaluate the effect of DDX3 inhibition on cell cycle progression over time, we performed timelapse microscopy of Fluorescent Ubiquitin Cell Cycle Indicators labeled cells after RK-33 or siDDX3 exposure. Single cell tracking indicated that DDX3 inhibition resulted in a global delay in cell cycle progression in interphase and mitosis. In addition, we observed an increase in endoreduplication. Overall, we conclude that DDX3 inhibition affects cells in all phases and causes a global cell cycle progression delay.

Behavioral weight loss for the management of menopausal hot flashes: a pilot study. Although adiposity has been considered to be protective against hot flashes, newer data suggest positive relationships between hot flashes and adiposity. No studies have been specifically designed to test whether weight loss reduces hot flashes. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of behavioral weight loss in reducing hot flashes. Forty overweight or obese women with hot flashes (>= 4 hot flashes/d) were randomized to either behavioral weight loss intervention or wait-list control. Hot flashes were assessed before and after intervention via physiologic monitoring, diary, and questionnaire. Comparisons of changes in hot flashes and anthropometrics between conditions were performed via Wilcoxon tests. Study retention (83%) and intervention satisfaction (93.8%) were high. Most women (74.1%) reported that hot flash reduction was a major motivator for losing weight. Women randomized to the weight loss intervention lost more weight (-8.86 kg) than did women randomized to control (+0.23 kg; P < 0.0001). Women randomized to weight loss also showed greater reductions in questionnaire-reported hot flashes (2-wk hot flashes, -63.0) than did women in the control group (-28.0; P = 0.03)-a difference not demonstrated in other hot flash measures. Reductions in weight and hot flashes were significantly correlated (eg, r = 0.47, P = 0.006). This pilot study shows a behavioral weight loss program that is feasible, acceptable, and effective in producing weight loss among overweight or obese women with hot flashes. Findings indicate the importance of a larger study designed to test behavioral weight loss for hot flash reduction. Hot flash management could motivate women to engage in this health-promoting behavior.

pH-responsive DNA-binding activity of Helicobacter pylori NikR. Helicobacter pylori NikR (HpNikR) is a nickel-responsive transcription factor. In addition to a role in nickel homeostasis, HpNikR is proposed to serve as a master activator-repressor for H. pylori acid adaptation by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a battery of genes. One potential mechanism of this regulation is modulation of the DNA-binding activity of HpNikR by the decrease in internal pH that occurs upon exposure to acidic shock. To test this hypothesis, several properties of HpNikR were investigated under acidic conditions. At pH 5.8, the secondary and quaternary structures of the protein are not affected, and it still binds stoichiometric nickel in the same site, although with a slightly weaker affinity than that at pH 7.6. DNA-binding assays performed at pH 5.8 reveal that, in contrast to pH 7.6, HpNikR binds to the ureA promoter in a nickel-independent fashion. Binding to the nikR promoter at the lower pH is nickel dependent, however. Deletion of amino acids 3-11 of HpNikR abolished the nickel-responsive activity and enhanced nonspecific DNA binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of HpNikR indicates that either Asp7 or Asp8 in the N-terminus of HpNikR plays a part in the activation of DNA binding. Furthermore, Lys6 contributes selectively to complex formation with the nikR promoter sequence. The direct influence of pH on the activity of HpNikR may be critical to the role of this activator-repressor in the viability of H. pylori.

Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats. To evaluate the effects of different types of dietary fats on the hepatic lipid content and oxidative stress parameters in rat liver with experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups. The rats in the control group (n = 8) were on chow diet (Group 1), rats (n = 6) on methionine choline-deficient diet (MCDD) (Group 2), rats (n = 6) on MCDD enriched with olive oil (Group 3), rats (n = 6) on MCDD with fish oil (Group 4) and rats (n = 6) on MCDD with butter fat (Group 5). After 2 mo, blood and liver sections were examined for lipids composition and oxidative stress parameters. The liver weight/rat weight ratio increased in all treatment groups as compared with the control group. Severe fatty liver was seen in MCDD + fish oil and in MCDD + butter fat groups, but not in MCDD and MCDD + olive oil groups. The increase in hepatic triglycerides (TG) levels was blunted by 30% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.59 +/- 0.09) compared with MCDD group (0.85 +/- 0.04, P < 0.004), by 37% compared with MCDD + fish oil group (0.95 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001), and by 33% compared with MCDD + butter group (0.09 +/- 0.1, P < 0.01). The increase in serum TG was lowered by 10% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.9 +/- 0.07) compared with MCDD group (1.05 +/- 0.06). Hepatic cholesterol increased by 15-fold in MCDD group [(0.08 +/- 0.02, this increment was blunted by 21% in MCDD + fish oil group (0.09 +/- 0.02)]. In comparison with the control group, ratio of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-6/omega-3 increased in MCDD + olive oil, MCDD + fish oil and MCDD + butter fat groups by 345-, 30- and 397-fold, respectively. In comparison to MCDD group (1.58 +/- 0.08), hepatic MDA contents in MCDD + olive oil (3.3 +/- 0.6), MCDD + fish oil (3.0 +/- 0.4), and MCDD + butter group (2.9 +/- 0.36) were increased by 108%, 91% and 87%, respectively (P < 0.004). Hepatic paraoxonase activity decreased significantly in all treatment groups, mostly with MCDD + olive oil group (-68%). Olive oil decreases the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver of rats with NAFLD, but does not provide the greatest antioxidant activity.

The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity. Obesity activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in adipose tissue. Elevated levels of eosinophils with depression of monocyte and neutrophil indicate the deficiencies in the immune system of morbidly obese individuals. Actually, adipose tissue macrophages are functional antigen-presenting cells that promote the proliferation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing CD4+ T cells in adipose tissue of obese subjects. Eventually, diet-induced obesity is associated with the loss of tissue homeostasis and development of type 1 inflammatory responses in visceral adipose tissue. Activity of inducible indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) plays a major role under pro-inflammatory, IFN-gamma dominated settings. One of the two rate-limiting enzymes which can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenine is IDO-1. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) correlates with IDO-1 in adipose compartments. Actually, IDO-1-mediated tryptophan catabolism due to chronic immune activation is the cause of reduced tryptophan plasma levels and be considered as the driving force for food intake in morbidly obese patients. Thus, decrease in plasma tryptophan levels and subsequent reduction in serotonin (5-HT) production provokes satiety dysregulation that leads to increased caloric uptake and obesity. However, after bariatric surgery, weight reduction does not lead to normalization of IDO-1 activity. Furthermore, there is a connection between arginine and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates. Hence, abdominal obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability. IFN-gamma-induced activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and dissociation of endothelial adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)- phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)- endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway enhances oxidative stress production secondary to high-fat diet. Thus, reduced endothelial NO availability correlates with the increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides levels. Additionally, in obese patients, folate-deficiency leads to hyperhomocysteinemia. Folic acid confers protection against hyperhomocysteinemia-induced oxidative stress.

Yeast-derived potato patatins: Biochemical and biophysical characterization. Potato patatin is considered a valuable plant protein by the food industry for its exceptional functional properties and nutritional value. Nonetheless, it has not been widely used due to its low abundance in potatoes and high cost. Pichia pastoris was utilized for expression of patatin to overcome agricultural limitations. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of Patatin-B2 (rPatB2) and Patatin-17 (rPat17) is described. rPatB2 and rPat17 had higher zeta potential and superior solubility at various pH conditions in comparison with commercial patatin, whereas particle size distribution was similar. Inflection temperatures were higher than potato isolated patatins. Antioxidant capacity of rPatB2 and rPat17 was similar to that of commercial patatin and the specific enzymatic activity of rPatB2 was 5-fold higher than rPat17 and patatins isolated from potato. Results indicate yeast-derived patatin properties are comparable to patatins from potatoes, suggesting their potential use in various plant-based products such as meat and dairy analogues.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

Urological complications after radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer is naturally associated with a number of urological complications. In a review of 320 hospital records we found a 6.6% incidence of intraoperative injury to the bladder or ureters; in all cases the tumour had encroached on the organ. The incidence of postoperative fistula formation was 4.4%. Postoperative urodynamic studies of 116 patients after radical hysterectomy, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, quantified lower urinary tract dysfunction. A prospective study of 40 patients showed that 20% developed urinary stress-incontinence after surgery. Patients who had had surgery only showed an improvement in most urodynamic parameters over the years, while patients who had also had radiotherapy did not. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients after surgery only were satisfied with their condition and, years later, reported no complaints. They may just have become used to them, but half the patients who had also had radiotherapy reported complaints, mainly impaired bladder sensation, frequency and nocturia. Urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy is inevitable, but meticulous peri-operative management, regular follow-up examinations and psychological support can keep it to a minimum and help the patient to cope.

To describe an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease, we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and connect the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes to form a coherent narrative.

1. **Link between Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study" suggests that higher levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This implies that lipid metabolism plays a role in the pathophysiology of AD.

2. **Influence of Diet on Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease**: The study "Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats" indicates that dietary components, specifically monounsaturated fats (like those found in olive oil), can reduce hepatic lipid content. This reduction in lipid levels could potentially lower the risk of developing AD, given the association between high lipid levels and AD.

3. **Obesity, Inflammation, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity" discusses how obesity leads to chronic inflammation and immune activation, which can contribute to the development of AD. Obesity is also linked to alterations in lipid metabolism, further connecting it to AD risk.

4. **Homocysteine, Vascular Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The study "Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells" shows that elevated homocysteine levels, often associated with folate deficiency, can lead to vascular disease and potentially increase the risk of AD, as vascular factors are known to contribute to AD pathology.

5. **F3 Gene and Lipid Metabolism**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided abstracts, the F3 gene (encoding tissue factor) is involved in coagulation and has been implicated in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Variants of the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, could potentially influence an individual's lipid profile and, by extension, their risk of developing AD.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could exist through the following pathway:

- The F3 wt Allele influences lipid metabolism, potentially leading to higher levels of TC and LDL-C.
- Elevated TC and LDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease.
- Dietary factors and obesity, which are linked to lipid metabolism, can also modulate the risk of AD through inflammation and other mechanisms.
- Homocysteine levels, affected by folate status and potentially by genetic factors like the F3 gene, contribute to vascular disease and may indirectly influence AD risk.

This narrative suggests that the F3 wt Allele could indirectly contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's Disease by affecting lipid metabolism, which in turn is associated with AD. However, this relationship is speculative and based on connecting findings from different studies. Direct research on the F3 gene and its variants in the context of Alzheimer's Disease would be necessary to confirm such a relationship.

In the MCI patients, the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.30; 95%CI (0.01, 0.59); P = 0.041] had a significantly upward trend, while the LDL-C levels had no significant change, compared with HC subjects. However, there is no significant changes in HDL-C and TG levels in AD or MCI patients. Therefore, our results suggested that the elevated TC and LDL-C levels may be a potential risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Behavioral weight loss for the management of menopausal hot flashes: a pilot study. Although adiposity has been considered to be protective against hot flashes, newer data suggest positive relationships between hot flashes and adiposity. No studies have been specifically designed to test whether weight loss reduces hot flashes. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of behavioral weight loss in reducing hot flashes. Forty overweight or obese women with hot flashes (>= 4 hot flashes/d) were randomized to either behavioral weight loss intervention or wait-list control. Hot flashes were assessed before and after intervention via physiologic monitoring, diary, and questionnaire. Comparisons of changes in hot flashes and anthropometrics between conditions were performed via Wilcoxon tests. Study retention (83%) and intervention satisfaction (93.8%) were high. Most women (74.1%) reported that hot flash reduction was a major motivator for losing weight. Women randomized to the weight loss intervention lost more weight (-8.86 kg) than did women randomized to control (+0.23 kg; P < 0.0001). Women randomized to weight loss also showed greater reductions in questionnaire-reported hot flashes (2-wk hot flashes, -63.0) than did women in the control group (-28.0; P = 0.03)-a difference not demonstrated in other hot flash measures. Reductions in weight and hot flashes were significantly correlated (eg, r = 0.47, P = 0.006). This pilot study shows a behavioral weight loss program that is feasible, acceptable, and effective in producing weight loss among overweight or obese women with hot flashes. Findings indicate the importance of a larger study designed to test behavioral weight loss for hot flash reduction. Hot flash management could motivate women to engage in this health-promoting behavior.

pH-responsive DNA-binding activity of Helicobacter pylori NikR. Helicobacter pylori NikR (HpNikR) is a nickel-responsive transcription factor. In addition to a role in nickel homeostasis, HpNikR is proposed to serve as a master activator-repressor for H. pylori acid adaptation by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a battery of genes. One potential mechanism of this regulation is modulation of the DNA-binding activity of HpNikR by the decrease in internal pH that occurs upon exposure to acidic shock. To test this hypothesis, several properties of HpNikR were investigated under acidic conditions. At pH 5.8, the secondary and quaternary structures of the protein are not affected, and it still binds stoichiometric nickel in the same site, although with a slightly weaker affinity than that at pH 7.6. DNA-binding assays performed at pH 5.8 reveal that, in contrast to pH 7.6, HpNikR binds to the ureA promoter in a nickel-independent fashion. Binding to the nikR promoter at the lower pH is nickel dependent, however. Deletion of amino acids 3-11 of HpNikR abolished the nickel-responsive activity and enhanced nonspecific DNA binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of HpNikR indicates that either Asp7 or Asp8 in the N-terminus of HpNikR plays a part in the activation of DNA binding. Furthermore, Lys6 contributes selectively to complex formation with the nikR promoter sequence. The direct influence of pH on the activity of HpNikR may be critical to the role of this activator-repressor in the viability of H. pylori.

Antrodia Cinnamomea Reduces Carbon Tetrachloride-induced Hepatotoxicity In Male Wister Rats. Antrodia cinnamomea is found with polysaccharides, lipids, vitamins, fibers and ash (minerals) and is well known in Taiwan as a traditional Chinese medicine. Its biological activities have been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-fatigue, anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects, but its protective effects on liver function are still unclear. We determined if Antrodia cinnamomea was hepatoprotective against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity in Wistar rats. Six groups were used in the study: 1) control (no induction by CCl4); 2) negative control (CCl4-induction and no treatment); 3) positive control (silymarin treatment); 4) groups 4-6 were treated with CC14 and different concentrations (350 mg/kg, 1,400 mg/kg, 3,150 mg/kg) of Antrodia cinnamomea. Blood and liver samples of rats were harvested and then detected by biochemical and tissue histochemical analysis. Activity of the antioxidative enzymes glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase in the liver were also monitored. Only the high-dose treatment was able to decrease serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels and improve liver function. High and medium doses increased total liver protein and reduced hydroxyproline. It was also observed that the high dose treatment reduced lipid peroxidation. Liver sections of CC14 treated animals receiving Antrodia cinnamomea showed less fibrosis compared to the CCl4 control group. This finding suggested that Antrodia cinnamomea can either enhance liver recovering from CCl4 damage or attenuate CCl4 toxicity in rats.

Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats. To evaluate the effects of different types of dietary fats on the hepatic lipid content and oxidative stress parameters in rat liver with experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups. The rats in the control group (n = 8) were on chow diet (Group 1), rats (n = 6) on methionine choline-deficient diet (MCDD) (Group 2), rats (n = 6) on MCDD enriched with olive oil (Group 3), rats (n = 6) on MCDD with fish oil (Group 4) and rats (n = 6) on MCDD with butter fat (Group 5). After 2 mo, blood and liver sections were examined for lipids composition and oxidative stress parameters. The liver weight/rat weight ratio increased in all treatment groups as compared with the control group. Severe fatty liver was seen in MCDD + fish oil and in MCDD + butter fat groups, but not in MCDD and MCDD + olive oil groups. The increase in hepatic triglycerides (TG) levels was blunted by 30% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.59 +/- 0.09) compared with MCDD group (0.85 +/- 0.04, P < 0.004), by 37% compared with MCDD + fish oil group (0.95 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001), and by 33% compared with MCDD + butter group (0.09 +/- 0.1, P < 0.01). The increase in serum TG was lowered by 10% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.9 +/- 0.07) compared with MCDD group (1.05 +/- 0.06). Hepatic cholesterol increased by 15-fold in MCDD group [(0.08 +/- 0.02, this increment was blunted by 21% in MCDD + fish oil group (0.09 +/- 0.02)]. In comparison with the control group, ratio of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-6/omega-3 increased in MCDD + olive oil, MCDD + fish oil and MCDD + butter fat groups by 345-, 30- and 397-fold, respectively. In comparison to MCDD group (1.58 +/- 0.08), hepatic MDA contents in MCDD + olive oil (3.3 +/- 0.6), MCDD + fish oil (3.0 +/- 0.4), and MCDD + butter group (2.9 +/- 0.36) were increased by 108%, 91% and 87%, respectively (P < 0.004). Hepatic paraoxonase activity decreased significantly in all treatment groups, mostly with MCDD + olive oil group (-68%). Olive oil decreases the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver of rats with NAFLD, but does not provide the greatest antioxidant activity.

The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity. Obesity activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in adipose tissue. Elevated levels of eosinophils with depression of monocyte and neutrophil indicate the deficiencies in the immune system of morbidly obese individuals. Actually, adipose tissue macrophages are functional antigen-presenting cells that promote the proliferation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing CD4+ T cells in adipose tissue of obese subjects. Eventually, diet-induced obesity is associated with the loss of tissue homeostasis and development of type 1 inflammatory responses in visceral adipose tissue. Activity of inducible indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) plays a major role under pro-inflammatory, IFN-gamma dominated settings. One of the two rate-limiting enzymes which can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenine is IDO-1. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) correlates with IDO-1 in adipose compartments. Actually, IDO-1-mediated tryptophan catabolism due to chronic immune activation is the cause of reduced tryptophan plasma levels and be considered as the driving force for food intake in morbidly obese patients. Thus, decrease in plasma tryptophan levels and subsequent reduction in serotonin (5-HT) production provokes satiety dysregulation that leads to increased caloric uptake and obesity. However, after bariatric surgery, weight reduction does not lead to normalization of IDO-1 activity. Furthermore, there is a connection between arginine and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates. Hence, abdominal obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability. IFN-gamma-induced activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and dissociation of endothelial adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)- phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)- endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway enhances oxidative stress production secondary to high-fat diet. Thus, reduced endothelial NO availability correlates with the increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides levels. Additionally, in obese patients, folate-deficiency leads to hyperhomocysteinemia. Folic acid confers protection against hyperhomocysteinemia-induced oxidative stress.

Yeast-derived potato patatins: Biochemical and biophysical characterization. Potato patatin is considered a valuable plant protein by the food industry for its exceptional functional properties and nutritional value. Nonetheless, it has not been widely used due to its low abundance in potatoes and high cost. Pichia pastoris was utilized for expression of patatin to overcome agricultural limitations. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of Patatin-B2 (rPatB2) and Patatin-17 (rPat17) is described. rPatB2 and rPat17 had higher zeta potential and superior solubility at various pH conditions in comparison with commercial patatin, whereas particle size distribution was similar. Inflection temperatures were higher than potato isolated patatins. Antioxidant capacity of rPatB2 and rPat17 was similar to that of commercial patatin and the specific enzymatic activity of rPatB2 was 5-fold higher than rPat17 and patatins isolated from potato. Results indicate yeast-derived patatin properties are comparable to patatins from potatoes, suggesting their potential use in various plant-based products such as meat and dairy analogues.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

Urological complications after radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer is naturally associated with a number of urological complications. In a review of 320 hospital records we found a 6.6% incidence of intraoperative injury to the bladder or ureters; in all cases the tumour had encroached on the organ. The incidence of postoperative fistula formation was 4.4%. Postoperative urodynamic studies of 116 patients after radical hysterectomy, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, quantified lower urinary tract dysfunction. A prospective study of 40 patients showed that 20% developed urinary stress-incontinence after surgery. Patients who had had surgery only showed an improvement in most urodynamic parameters over the years, while patients who had also had radiotherapy did not. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients after surgery only were satisfied with their condition and, years later, reported no complaints. They may just have become used to them, but half the patients who had also had radiotherapy reported complaints, mainly impaired bladder sensation, frequency and nocturia. Urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy is inevitable, but meticulous peri-operative management, regular follow-up examinations and psychological support can keep it to a minimum and help the patient to cope.

Based on the provided scientific abstracts, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease might exist through the following mechanisms:

1. **Lipid Metabolism and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study" suggests that high levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is involved in lipid metabolism, and variations in this gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence lipid profiles, potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

2. **Inflammation and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease" highlights the link between inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. An indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease might exist through the modulation of inflammatory pathways, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

3. **Homocysteine and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells" suggests that elevated homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and thrombosis, which are also risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. The F3 gene is involved in the regulation of homocysteine levels, and variations in this gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, might influence homocysteine metabolism, potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

4. **Obesity and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "The Interactions Between Kynurenine, Folate, Methionine and Pteridine Pathways in Obesity" highlights the link between obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Obesity is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and the F3 gene is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. An indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease might exist through the modulation of obesity-related pathways, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

In summary, the indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's disease might exist through the modulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, homocysteine levels, and obesity-related pathways, which are all known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and to confirm the existence of this indirect relationship.

Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) affect a large percent of the population worldwide. Experimental studies have revealed that T2DM and AD share several molecular processes that underlie their respective degenerative pathology. Based on this information, we quantified TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels, serum glucose, serum triglyceride, hepatic triglyceride, serum AST, serum ALT and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in various rat tissues. HFD was fed to rats resulting in increased body weight, fasting blood glucose, IL-6, TNF-alpha levels, hepatic triglyceride, serum AST, serum ALT and BuChE. SK0506 treatment significantly prevented weight gain induced by HFD feeding. SK0506, but not Rosiglitazone, significantly reduced serum and hepatic triglycerides levels. Treatment with SK0506 also ameliorated elevated levels of both inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST) significantly in HFD fed rats. BuChE activity also reduced in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of rats treated by SK0506. In conclusion, current study has opened new potential avenues towards research for management of T2DM and AD by Chinese herbal extracts, ''SK0506''.

Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study. Serum lipid levels such as triglyceride and cholesterol has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it still remains controversial in different studies. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the importance of serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in AD and MCI patients. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) system database were used to identify 17 studies (10 AD-only + 4 MCI-only + 3 shared AD/MCI), including 2333 cases and 3615 healthy controls (HC). We found that compared with HC, both the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.58; 95%CI (0.25, 0.90); P = 0.001) and the serum LDL-C levels [SMD = 0.7780; 95%CI (0.3940, 1.1521); P = 0.000] were higher in cognitive impairment population (including AD and MCI) than those in HC, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed the serum TC and LDL-C levels in AD and MCI patients. We found that the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.76; 95% CI (0.13, 1.40); P = 0.019]1 and the LDL-C levels [SMD = 1.40; 95% CI (0.70, 2.10; P = 0.000] were increased in AD patients. In the MCI patients, the serum TC levels [SMD = 0.30; 95%CI (0.01, 0.59); P = 0.041] had a significantly upward trend, while the LDL-C levels had no significant change, compared with HC subjects. However, there is no significant changes in HDL-C and TG levels in AD or MCI patients. Therefore, our results suggested that the elevated TC and LDL-C levels may be a potential risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Antrodia Cinnamomea Reduces Carbon Tetrachloride-induced Hepatotoxicity In Male Wister Rats. Antrodia cinnamomea is found with polysaccharides, lipids, vitamins, fibers and ash (minerals) and is well known in Taiwan as a traditional Chinese medicine. Its biological activities have been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-fatigue, anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects, but its protective effects on liver function are still unclear. We determined if Antrodia cinnamomea was hepatoprotective against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity in Wistar rats. Six groups were used in the study: 1) control (no induction by CCl4); 2) negative control (CCl4-induction and no treatment); 3) positive control (silymarin treatment); 4) groups 4-6 were treated with CC14 and different concentrations (350 mg/kg, 1,400 mg/kg, 3,150 mg/kg) of Antrodia cinnamomea. Blood and liver samples of rats were harvested and then detected by biochemical and tissue histochemical analysis. Activity of the antioxidative enzymes glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase in the liver were also monitored. Only the high-dose treatment was able to decrease serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels and improve liver function. High and medium doses increased total liver protein and reduced hydroxyproline. It was also observed that the high dose treatment reduced lipid peroxidation. Liver sections of CC14 treated animals receiving Antrodia cinnamomea showed less fibrosis compared to the CCl4 control group. This finding suggested that Antrodia cinnamomea can either enhance liver recovering from CCl4 damage or attenuate CCl4 toxicity in rats.

Strategy for the maximization of clinically relevant information from hepatitis C virus, RT-PCR quantification. The increasing clinical application of viral load assays for monitoring viral infections has been an incentive for the development of standardized tests for the hepatitis C virus. To develop a simple model for the prediction of baseline viral load in individuals infected with the hepatitis C virus. Viral load quantification of each patient's first sample was assessed by RT-PCR-ELISA using the Roche MONITOR assay in triplicate. Genotype of the infecting virus was identified by reverse line probe hybridization, using amplicons resulting from the qualitative HCV Roche AMPLICOR assay. Retrospective evaluation of first quantitative values suggested that 82.4% (n=168/204) of individuals had a viral load between 4.3 and 6.7 log(10) viral copies per ml. A few patients (3.4%; n=7/204) have a serum viremia less than the lower limit of the linear range of the RT-PCR assay. Subsequent, prospective evaluation of hepatitis C viral load of all new patients using a model based on the dynamic range of viral load in the retrospective group correctly predicted the dynamic range in 75.9% (n=33/54). The dynamic range of hepatitis C viremia extends beyond the linear range of the Roche MONITOR assay. Accurate determination of serum viremia is substantially improved by dilution of specimens prior to quantification.

Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats. To evaluate the effects of different types of dietary fats on the hepatic lipid content and oxidative stress parameters in rat liver with experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups. The rats in the control group (n = 8) were on chow diet (Group 1), rats (n = 6) on methionine choline-deficient diet (MCDD) (Group 2), rats (n = 6) on MCDD enriched with olive oil (Group 3), rats (n = 6) on MCDD with fish oil (Group 4) and rats (n = 6) on MCDD with butter fat (Group 5). After 2 mo, blood and liver sections were examined for lipids composition and oxidative stress parameters. The liver weight/rat weight ratio increased in all treatment groups as compared with the control group. Severe fatty liver was seen in MCDD + fish oil and in MCDD + butter fat groups, but not in MCDD and MCDD + olive oil groups. The increase in hepatic triglycerides (TG) levels was blunted by 30% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.59 +/- 0.09) compared with MCDD group (0.85 +/- 0.04, P < 0.004), by 37% compared with MCDD + fish oil group (0.95 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001), and by 33% compared with MCDD + butter group (0.09 +/- 0.1, P < 0.01). The increase in serum TG was lowered by 10% in MCDD + olive oil group (0.9 +/- 0.07) compared with MCDD group (1.05 +/- 0.06). Hepatic cholesterol increased by 15-fold in MCDD group [(0.08 +/- 0.02, this increment was blunted by 21% in MCDD + fish oil group (0.09 +/- 0.02)]. In comparison with the control group, ratio of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-6/omega-3 increased in MCDD + olive oil, MCDD + fish oil and MCDD + butter fat groups by 345-, 30- and 397-fold, respectively. In comparison to MCDD group (1.58 +/- 0.08), hepatic MDA contents in MCDD + olive oil (3.3 +/- 0.6), MCDD + fish oil (3.0 +/- 0.4), and MCDD + butter group (2.9 +/- 0.36) were increased by 108%, 91% and 87%, respectively (P < 0.004). Hepatic paraoxonase activity decreased significantly in all treatment groups, mostly with MCDD + olive oil group (-68%). Olive oil decreases the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver of rats with NAFLD, but does not provide the greatest antioxidant activity.

Activity of inducible indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) plays a major role under pro-inflammatory, IFN-gamma dominated settings. One of the two rate-limiting enzymes which can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenine is IDO-1. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) correlates with IDO-1 in adipose compartments. Actually, IDO-1-mediated tryptophan catabolism due to chronic immune activation is the cause of reduced tryptophan plasma levels and be considered as the driving force for food intake in morbidly obese patients. Thus, decrease in plasma tryptophan levels and subsequent reduction in serotonin (5-HT) production provokes satiety dysregulation that leads to increased caloric uptake and obesity. However, after bariatric surgery, weight reduction does not lead to normalization of IDO-1 activity. Furthermore, there is a connection between arginine and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates. Hence, abdominal obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability. IFN-gamma-induced activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and dissociation of endothelial adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)- phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)- endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway enhances oxidative stress production secondary to high-fat diet. Thus, reduced endothelial NO availability correlates with the increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides levels. Additionally, in obese patients, folate-deficiency leads to hyperhomocysteinemia. Folic acid confers protection against hyperhomocysteinemia-induced oxidative stress.

Yeast-derived potato patatins: Biochemical and biophysical characterization. Potato patatin is considered a valuable plant protein by the food industry for its exceptional functional properties and nutritional value. Nonetheless, it has not been widely used due to its low abundance in potatoes and high cost. Pichia pastoris was utilized for expression of patatin to overcome agricultural limitations. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of Patatin-B2 (rPatB2) and Patatin-17 (rPat17) is described. rPatB2 and rPat17 had higher zeta potential and superior solubility at various pH conditions in comparison with commercial patatin, whereas particle size distribution was similar. Inflection temperatures were higher than potato isolated patatins. Antioxidant capacity of rPatB2 and rPat17 was similar to that of commercial patatin and the specific enzymatic activity of rPatB2 was 5-fold higher than rPat17 and patatins isolated from potato. Results indicate yeast-derived patatin properties are comparable to patatins from potatoes, suggesting their potential use in various plant-based products such as meat and dairy analogues.

Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells. Elevated blood levels of homocysteine represent an independent risk factor for premature arterial vascular disease and thrombosis. We investigated whether homocysteine could induce tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Homocysteine increased cellular TF activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of homocysteine (0.1 to 0.6 mmol/L), similar to those found in the blood of patients with homocystinuria, enhanced TF activity by 25% to 100%. Other sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, homocystine, cysteine, and methionine) induced less TF activity than did homocysteine; however, beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were more effective than homocysteine in increasing TF activity. Preincubation of homocysteine with a sulfhydryl inhibitor such as N-ethylmaleimide prevented homocysteine induction of TF activity. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction method indicated that homocysteine increased TF mRNA in endothelial cells. These results indicate that an atherogenic amino acid, homocysteine, can initiate coagulation by the TF pathway through a mechanism involving the free thiol group of the amino acid and by TF gene transcription. These data support the hypothesis that perturbation of vascular coagulant mechanisms may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with homocystinuria.

The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR-141716A induces penile erection in male rats: involvement of paraventricular glutamic acid and nitric oxide. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5, 1 and 2 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A were reduced by the prior injection into the PVN of the cannabinoid CB1 agonists WIN 55,212-2 (5 microg) or HU 210 (5 microg), given into the paraventricular nucleus at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify NO2- concentration. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (20 microg), a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 microg), a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, the excitatory amino acid NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine ((+)MK 801) (1 microg), or the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2 microg) injected into the PVN 15 min before SR 141716A. In contrast, the inducible NO synthase inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (20 microg), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.2 microg), the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (10 microg), and the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg), were ineffective. Despite its inability to reduce penile erection and NO2- increase induced by SR 141716A when injected into the PVN, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8 -vasotocin (1 microg) reduced almost completely penile erection without reducing paraventricular NO2- increase when injected into the lateral ventricles 15 min before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716 induces penile erection by a mechanism (possibly activation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission), which causes the activation of neuronal NO synthase in paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection.

Urological complications after radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Radical abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer is naturally associated with a number of urological complications. In a review of 320 hospital records we found a 6.6% incidence of intraoperative injury to the bladder or ureters; in all cases the tumour had encroached on the organ. The incidence of postoperative fistula formation was 4.4%. Postoperative urodynamic studies of 116 patients after radical hysterectomy, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, quantified lower urinary tract dysfunction. A prospective study of 40 patients showed that 20% developed urinary stress-incontinence after surgery. Patients who had had surgery only showed an improvement in most urodynamic parameters over the years, while patients who had also had radiotherapy did not. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients after surgery only were satisfied with their condition and, years later, reported no complaints. They may just have become used to them, but half the patients who had also had radiotherapy reported complaints, mainly impaired bladder sensation, frequency and nocturia. Urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy is inevitable, but meticulous peri-operative management, regular follow-up examinations and psychological support can keep it to a minimum and help the patient to cope.

To describe an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease, we must consider the information provided in the abstracts and connect the key findings, underlying mechanisms, and intermediate entities or processes to form a coherent narrative.

1. **Link between Lipid Metabolism and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "Elevated serum TC and LDL-C levels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study" suggests that elevated serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This implies that dysregulation in lipid metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.

2. **Influence of Diet on Lipid Metabolism and Inflammation**: The abstract "Monounsaturated fat decreases hepatic lipid content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats" indicates that dietary components, such as monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil), can reduce hepatic lipid content and potentially influence inflammation in the body. This is relevant because inflammation is a known factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

3. **Connection between Inflammation, Immune Response, and Alzheimer's Disease**: The abstract "Targeting BuChE-inflammatory pathway by SK0506 to manage type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease" highlights the connection between inflammation and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that managing inflammatory pathways could be beneficial in treating AD.

4. **Role of Homocysteine in Vascular Disease and Potential Link to Alzheimer's**: The abstract "Homocysteine, a risk factor for premature vascular disease and thrombosis, induces tissue factor activity in endothelial cells" shows that homocysteine, an amino acid linked to vascular disease, can induce tissue factor activity, potentially leading to thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels have also been associated with Alzheimer's disease, possibly through vascular mechanisms or direct neurotoxic effects.

5. **F3 Gene and Coagulation**: The F3 gene encodes for tissue factor, which is crucial in the initiation of blood coagulation. Variants of the F3 gene, such as the F3 wt Allele, could potentially influence coagulation pathways and, by extension, affect vascular health and the risk of vascular-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.

Connecting these elements, an indirect relationship between the F3 wt Allele and Alzheimer's Disease could be proposed as follows:

- The F3 wt Allele influences tissue factor expression and, consequently, blood coagulation.
- Altered coagulation pathways can affect vascular health, potentially leading to conditions like atherosclerosis.
- Atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia (elevated TC and LDL-C levels) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, possibly through inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms.
- Dietary factors and metabolic conditions (like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) that influence lipid metabolism and inflammation could further modulate this risk.

In summary, while the F3 wt Allele may not directly cause Alzheimer's disease, its potential impact on coagulation and vascular health, combined with the known associations between vascular disease, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and Alzheimer's disease, suggests an indirect relationship. This relationship is mediated by intermediate factors such as lipid metabolism dysregulation, inflammation, and vascular health.
